The 600D primarily with the kit 18-135mm lens but it also comes in a range of other kit configurations including a more standard 18-55mm .
 As the sensor and image processor of the 550D and 600D is identical, image quality is exactly the same .
 What this means to photographers who haven't experienced the 550D is excellent colour rendition and noise control at high ISO levels .
 Dynamic range is very good, though there can be some highlight clipping in contrasty situations when using automatic exposures .
 JPEG processing is very good through most ISO levels .
 ISO 3200 and 6400 (the highest of the native ISO range) produce acceptable levels of noise for reduced or web resolution use .
 Colour noise at full magnification is quite pronounced though .
 Video quality, as with the 550D, is excellent .
 It's simply the best you can get on any SLR in this particular price bracket .
 Colour rendition is superb and the video image is smooth .
 Even the internal microphone seems to produce better audio than on the 550D .
 The 600D also gets manual audio levels (though still no method to monitor the audio before recording apart from referring to the visual meter) .
