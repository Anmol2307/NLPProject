Purchased this about 3 weeks back, and am amazed at its performance:
- My decision to buy Nikon D3100 v/s Canon 1100D was not bad. Though more expensive, the feel in hand, compactness, sensor size, HD movies capability, 3" dispalay, rubber grip tilted my decision towards Nikon.
- excellent image quality and low noise at 14MP, even with flash.
- Kit lens has its limitations, but ok for me to begin with experimenting.
- I manual focusing for macro / close up shots much better than autofocus.
- The HD video mode delivers excellent quality movies. 
- The built in flash looks small, but has enough power to take good snaps at indoor functions. I recently took more than 150 photos at my niece's wedding, and the result was great.
- I prefer to shoot in A (aperture priority) or Manual M mode.
- I plan to buy a 50mm stand alone lens followed by 55 - 300 zoom.
- In short, go for Nikon D3100!!
