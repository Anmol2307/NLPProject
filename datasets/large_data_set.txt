[t] troubleshooting ad-2500 and ad-2600 no picture scrolling b/w . 
##repost from january 13 , 2004 with a better fit title . 
##does your apex dvd player only play dvd audio without video ? 
##or does it play audio and video but scrolling in black and white ? 
##before you try to return the player or waste hours calling apex tech support , or run the player over with your car , try these simple troubleshooting ideas first . 
##no picture : 
##hopefully you still have the remote control . 
##if you tossed it out the window , you need to fetch it . 
##using the remote control , press the i/p button located on the bottom right corner of the remote . 
##the i/p button switches the tv display between interlace and progressive . 
##if this doesnt bring back the picture , try pressing this button without playing a dvd . 
##if you dont get video back , now you can run the player over with your car ! 
##picture scrolling in b/w : 
##you need the remote control for this so you better get it from your dog before he burries it in the backyard . 
##press the p/n button located on the bottom right corner of the remote . 
##the p/n button switches your dvd players video output signal between pal and ntsc . 
##by pressing p/n , you should be able to get a good picture on the screen . 
##for other problems go to http://www.apexdigitalinc.com/support.asp 
##i hope i have helped you continue to enjoy the apex dvd player with these troubleshooting tips . 
##i have done some research and experimenting with the remote when my apex ad-2500 seemed to have lost its video signal . 
i/p button[+2]##im a more happier person after discovering the i/p button ! 
##the button was probably accidentally pushed to cause the black screen in the first place . 
dvd player[+2]##but , if you 're looking for my opinion of the apex dvd player , i love it ! 
dvd player[+1][p]##it practically plays almost everything you give it . 
player[+2],sound[-1]##i 've had the player for about 2 years now and it still performs nicely with the exception of an occasional wwhhhrrr sound from the motor . 
price[+2]##for the price it is a well spent investment ! 
##i would recommend buying one . 
[t] incredibe price / performance . 
##i 've owned 6 or 7 dvd players since 1998 . 
dvd player[+3][p]##this is by far the nicest one , in so many ways . 
look[+3],panel button layout[+3],feature[+2]##it 's very sleek looking with a very good front panel button layout , and it has a great feature set . 
forward[+2], rewind[+2]##its fast-forward and rewind work much more smoothly and consistently than those of other models i 've had . 
video format[+3]##it plays alternate video formats ( vcds , svcds , cvds ) very well . 
price[+3]##and amazon.com has it for such a great price -- how can you go wrong ? 
##i 've bought one for the den and will buy a 2nd one for the bedroom . 
##strengths are well listed by other reviewers . 
play[+2], dvd-r[+1]##what got me to buy was the reviewer that said it would play dvd-rs fill of files ( e. , mp3s ) . 
dvd-r[+1][p]##it sure does ! 
dvd-r[+2][p]##that 's a rare and valuable feature . 
##i have a dvd burner on my computer and a zillion mp3s , and it 's a lot nicer to access them 4.5 gb at a time ( dvd-r ) than 0.7 gb at a time ( cd-r ) ! 
audio output[+2]##another nice thing is that the unit has both optical and coax digital audio outputs , though the latter was not mentioned in the literature i 'd scanned before buying . 
##saved me from having to buy an expensive optical cable , as i already had a coax cable . 
forward[+2]##at double-speed ( 2x forward speed ) , it still plays mp3s with sound -- they are pitch-corrected and smooth , but twice as fast ! 
##i wish it would do the same for movies , but that 's one rare / cool feature you will have to forgo . 
remote control[-1], mp3 filename[-1]##weaknesses are minor : the feel and layout of the remote control are only so-so ; it does n't show the complete filenames of mp3s with really long names ; you must cycle through every zoom setting ( 2x , 3x , 4x , 1/2x , etc. ) before getting back to normal size [ sorry if i 'm just ignorant of a way to get back to 1x quickly ] . 
##if you 're a bargain hunter and you want a great feature set for a rock-bottom price , i highly recommend this model . 
finish[+2]##update : the finish is more " mirror " than silver -- and i like it ! 
[t] doesnt play new disney movies . 
play[-2], disney movie[-2]##many of our disney movies do n't play on this dvd player . 
##i spoke to a rep. at apex and was told that a new format is being used and we wont be able to view any disney movies made in the last couple months . 
[t] poor quality - problem with dual-layer dvd 's . 
dual-layer dvd[-2]##player has a problem with dual-layer dvd 's such as alias season 1 and season 2 . 
##for the money , get a better quality player . 
player[+1], look[+3]##player works and looks great - if you can get the dvd 's to play . 
player[-3]##i know the saying is " you get what you pay for " but at this stage of game dvd players must have better quality than this - there is no excuse . 
apex[-3]##will never purchase apex again . 
customer service[-3], technical support[-3]##customer service and technical support are overloaded and nonresponsive - tells you about the quality of their products and their willingness to stand behind them . 
##pass this player up , and never believe the reviews on a product right before christmas ! 
[t] has destroyed several of my dvds and cds . 
case[+2]##for the first few weeks , this player was everything i expected it to be , an affordable multi-format dvd player with a stylish slim case as advertised . 
dvd[-2], read[-2], play[-2]##then my dvds would stop playing in the middle , or not even be read at all . 
cd[-2]##new cds almost always began skipping after a few plays . 
player[-3]##i thought it was just the player , but then i started checking the discs to find that the apex 2600 is actually ruining my media . 
##there are funny little ridges on the dvd that look like the slice of a tree trunk ! 
player[-3]##this player is not worth any price and i recommend that you do n't purchase it . 
##i intend to contact the company , but from what i 've read . 
##i just got screwed out of fifty bucks . 
support[-3][u]##apex does n't answer the phone . 
##* sigh . 
[t] their customer service sucks . 
customer service[-2]##no way to contact their customer service . 
quality[-3]##very bad quality . 
[t] great value . 
player[+2]##i bought this apex 2600 dvd player for myself at christmas because it got good reviews as a good value for the money on a variety of different sites . 
player[+1]##i took it to my father 's house to play a tom jones concert dvd and he loved the player so much i gave it to him . 
##now i need to buy myself another one ! 
player[+2][p]##have used it frequently and have had no problems . 
##i always research electronics online before i buy because even within the same company , some models are better than others . 
player[+2][p]##i liked this one enough to buy another . 
apex[+2]##my dad also has an apex tv and it was another great value for the money . 
picture quality[+2],feature[+2]##great quality picture and features . 
[t] 2 out of three ai n't good . 
##thought i 'd weigh in here with my stats . 
##i 've bought 3 apex dvd players now . 
player[-2][p]##they play just about everything , but # 2 and # 3 died very shortly after getting them . 
##i am back to using # 1 . 
player[-1]##nice machines , but i consider their quality pretty low now . 
[t] buy a better known brand name . 
player[-2][u]##this item broke just two weeks after i gave it to my kids for christmas . 
door[-2]##the door would not close . 
customer service[-3]##i tried to contact apex to return it ( i missed the amazon return period ) and it took 3 months to get through to their customer service dept . 
##i am still trying to resolve it four months later . 
[t] piece of crap .. . 
look[+2], feature[+2]##it looks great - and is loaded with features . 
player[-2][p]##unfortunately it turns out to be the " disposable " type . 
player[-2][u]##have had problems since the first day 
play[-2], dvd[-2]##- not playing some dvds and then finally after less than 60 days , it just would not recognize anything i pop in it . 
##save money on the long run - buy something decent once instead of buying cheap every month . 
[t] i 've had no problems . 
apex[+2]##the apex 2600 has been a steady performer for me . 
player[+1][p]##i bought mine in december of 2003 , and have had no real problems with it . 
heat[-1][u]##it does tend to run quite hot and should be given lots of room for air circulation . 
smell[-2]##it did also seem to have a strong " new electronics " smell for some time . 
freezing[-1]##the only thing i did experience was a problem of the player freezing while playing , which i was able to clear by opening it up and blowing it out with " canned air . " 
##this problem vanished after the first month , so i assume it was a temporary dust issue . 
##the two main reasons i had for getting this model were the range of disks types played and the recommendation of a friend . 
player[+2]##( he had owned two apex dvd players , and was pleased with both of them . ) 
jpeg slideshow[+2],mpeg1[+1]##the fact that this model would play jpeg slideshows was a big plus for me as a visual artist , and i discovered by accident ( it is not mentioned anywhere in the literature ) that it will play mpeg1 files on a regular cd-r data disk without vcd formatting . 
remote[-1]##the remote is okay , but i am not a fan of remotes with tiny buttons . 
button[-2]##i especially like the more commonly used buttons , such as play , pause , and stop , to be larger and conveniently placed . 
##while it is true that it will stand on end , it is also easy to knock over that way . 
zoom mode[-2]##i also did n't like the way it displayed information way down into the screen when you are in zoom mode . 
zoom[-2]##the zoom goes up and down in magnification , which is nice , but there is always a display of the zoom size about one-quarter of the way down from the top of the screen that interferes with viewing at most settings . 
onscreen display[-2]##having spent considerable time with professional video gear , i find onscreen displays annoying . 
##i have not used the progressive scan feature . 
##this model has come down in price since i purchased mine . 
##while it seems like some people have had trouble with theirs , mine has run well , and i would recommend it if you are considering a dvd player purchase . 
##any possible problems should be weighed against the bang-for-the-buck factor , along with the fact that companies like apex seldom have good after-sale support . 
player[+2][p]##while i would like to give it 3.5 stars instead of 4 , i gave it a 4 because it has run well for me during the time i have owned it . 
[t] do not buy this piece of junk . 
##i purchased this unit 3 months back and i think the unit knew when my warrenty expires . 
picture[-2], player[-3][p]##it is more than 90 days and it does not show the picture no matter what i do . 
##i can only hear the sound . 
##i changed video cables , tried connecting to tv on input1 and input2 but no help . 
##i think you get what you pay for stands true . 
[t] nice paperweight . 
player[-2]##i have had this player for 3 months and have been able to see a total of 6 dvd 's , after the frustration and aggrivation of getting the player to do it 's job . 
customer service[-3]##i have tried many times to get a hold of apex who does n't seem to answer their emails and telephone number is constantly busy as ( i believe ) the one lonely customer service rep is probably extremely overworked . 
##as i emailed to the the customer service department , the only thing this player has done consistantly is use enought electricity to keep the red led burning . 
##do yourself a favor and save your money to get something of better quality , or at least works . 
[t] worst piece of electronics i ever bought . 
##if i could give this a negative rating , i would . 
##i am surprised amazon still carries this after all of the continued problems . 
play[-2], disc[-2]##wo n't play a lot of discs . 
##i can only confirm what other customers have said - crap ! 
play[-2]##some movies it played yesterday , it wo n't play today . 
play[-2]##it wo n't play 80 % of my movies , which are all store boughten . 
tech support[-3]##tech support from apex is literally - nonexistent . 
##amazon , do your customers a big favor , do n't carry this item , and give them refunds ! 
##there should have been a recall on this product . 
##fair warning - do not buy . 
##i repeat - do n't wast your money . 
[t] do n't buy ! 
player[-3][u]##i bought 2 of this model for christmas presents and neither one of them work ! 
dvd player[-3]##it is embarassing getting phone calls from family members telling you that the dvd player you gave them less that 3 months ago is no longer working . 
##one stopped working in february and the other in march . 
##amazon has been working with me to refund my money , but they reminded me that i have past the 30 day return policy and this was a courtesy return . 
##i have had great experience with amazon , but i will probably not buy electronics any more from them to avoid any future return problems . 
[t] we had problems . 
dvd player[-2]##the dvd player does not work properly . 
player[-3]##the player usually plays dvd 's , but has occasional problems such as : 1 ) not recognizing a dvd 2 ) stopping a particular point in a movie every time we played it 3 ) not being able to access certain special features on a rental dvd . 
player[-2][p]##this has happened with several different dvd 's and occasionally if we keep trying something , it will work when it did not work one time before . 
customer support[-3]##after we discovered the problems , we tried to contact apex ( fkor 3 months ) , but we never got in touch with them.the customer support telephone number is always busy , and they do not answer their web customer support . 
[t] ok if you have a 2nd dvd player . 
##i have had this dvd player for about 3 months now . 
player[+2][p]##nothing has broken on it , and it plays all the dvds i have . 
play[-2], dvd[-2]##unfortunately it can 't play all of the dvd . 
##i have several tv shows on dvd so they are divided by episode . 
dvd[-2]##on 2 dvds so far it refuses to play certain episodes with no problems on the others on the dvd . 
##luckily i also have a ps2 which can play those episodes the player can 't . 
player[-2]##unfortunately i bought a player because the ps2 could n't play all my dvds , and now the player can 't play everything . 
[t] another person who had problem with picture after one use . 
##i purchased this as a christmas gift for my husband . 
work[+2]##we tried it out christmas night and it worked great . 
jpeg[+2]##even viewed cds full of jpgs . 
##we did n't get to use it again for over a month ( sad , i know ) . 
picture[-2], player[-2][p]##but when we went to use it again , there was sound but no picture . 
##we saw reviews that said the same thing , and also saw here that their customer service stinks . 
##though we were past the deadline for returns ( by a few days ) , i contacted amazon right away and pleaded for help . 
##they authorized my late return , and hopefully they are giving apex heck . 
apex[-3]##i hate apex but love amazon , and i tell everyone . 
##do not buy this player . 
player[-3][p]##who knows how many uses you 'll get out of it before it craps out , but it probably will . 
[t] frustrating just hope you never lose / break the remote for this player ! 
remote[-2]##we 've purchased 3 universal remotes so far-all claiming to work " apex " dvd players and none worked . 
##called customer service and basically was told to either keep buying univ. remotes to try or buy the replacement remote for $ 23 ( which is almost half of what i paid for the whole player ) . 
##if anybody knows of a remote to work this-i 'd love to hear from you ! 
dvd[-2], play[-2]##( on here of course ) also , a couple dvd 's would n't play and they were new ones ! 
[t] poor customer service . 
remote[-2]##i had to return the remote on this product because it appeared to be defective . 
##it took over 2 months and repeated follow-up to get it replaced . 
customer service[-3]##the customer service dept did not list a toll free number and it was a real hassle to get through on their regular line . 
apex[-3]##i would not be inclined to purchase an apex product again . 
[t] a piece of junk . 
door[-2]##door broke after a month . 
unit[-3]##unit took forever since the begiining to recognize and play discs . 
player[-2][p]##3 months of use and it no longer recognizes anything . 
##forget about it . 
##it 's money down the drain . 
##get cheaper panasonics or toshibas or even sonys . 
[t] to quote bart : " craptacular " . 
player[+1]##well , it was nice while it lasted . 
player[-2]##after @ 3 months , it stoppped playing higher number scenes on dvds . 
player[-3][u]##as an engineer , i am embarrassed for the engineering profession when such crap is released for sale . 
[t] poor quality . 
player[-3][p]##only used for 3 month before it 's down ! 
##i had hoped this was bought from walmart so that i could return it ! 
picture[-2]##it sends discoutinous signals to tv , so the tv has the pictures for one moment and has only the white noise for the other moment . 
color[-2]##the other thing i do n't like about this 2600 is that it makes the color look over saturated . 
##maybe it 's good for tvs with not so good color settings , but not good for my tv that already has very vibrant pictures . 
[t] returned after failing to play dvds . 
##i purchased the ad2600 after feeling comfortable with the reviews i read here on amazon . 
##as soon as i lifted the unit out of the box , i questioned my judgement . 
unit[-2][u]##the entire unit was poorly crafted . 
screw tip[-2]##there were sharp screw tips on the underside of the unit coming from inside that were obviously used to anchor the internal control board . 
dvd[-2], play[-2]##after hooking the thing up , i found that it would only played less than 50 % of the dvds i put in it . 
##most of the dvds i was trying were fairly new and were in great condition . 
player[-2]##the dvd player just would't recognize them . 
no disc[-2]##it would spin , read , spin some more and then show on the display that there was no disc . 
##i ended up sending the unit back to amazon . 
[t] apex ad2600 . 
format[+2][u],progressive scan[+2]##this dvd player plays raw mpeg2 and mpeg1 videos , jpeg , wma , cdr / cdrw / dvdr / dvdrw , and of course plays dvd movies from uk. i love the aiff , progressive scan feature . 
##now it would have gotten 5 stars had this baby come with features to upgrade the firmware and was able to play divx or avi videos . 
##but for $ 49.99 go get one ! 
##features and looks this dvd player is overpriced had it come with sony or one of the other top brand names . 
[t] customer service nonexistant . 
player[-3]##i have not even used my new dvd player and already i am disapointed ! 
##i have been trying for over a week to contact apex . 
customer service[-3]##they will not respond to my emails ( promised turnaround time is 24 hours ) and the phone line is constantly busy . 
##all i am looking for is a rebate form ! 
[t] what a buy .. . 
##i accually did n't buy the apex ad-2600 from amazon but , the reviews i found here helped me purchase it . 
##i have owned an apex ad-3201 for close to 3 years now and i love that deck . 
feature[+2]##because of it 's hidden features ( no macrovision , non-regional ) i keep this baby around to watch non-american region dvd 's . 
##however , the ad-2600 does n't have this feature ( for now ) . 
play[+2], different file[+2]##the cool thing about the ad-2600 it plays alot of different file like mp3 , wma cds , jpeg and kodak picture cds , dvd 's , dvd - / + r 's . 
play[+2], mpeg[+2]##it 's not a listed feature but , the one thing that sold the unit is that it plays mpeg video . 
mpeg[+2][p]##i find this to be a great feature . 
play[+2][p]##i 've tried playing all of these discs and they all play great . 
feature[+2]##for the money apex machines have good features . 
##you can 't find the mpeg playback on high priced units . 
design[+2]##it 's low profile , space saving design looks nice . 
player[+2][u]##i find the apex ad-2600 to be a great buy . 
[t] avoid apex dvd players - even if they 're free ! 
##i received this dvd player free with the purchase of a palm tungsten e from officemax . 
player[-3][p]##now i know why - they are pieces of junk . 
no disc[-2], screen[-3][u]##less than a month later the screen freezes and eventually shows " no disc . " 
##this is the second apex dvd player i 've had - and the last . 
##my first player ( model ad-500a ) went into the trash about 6 months after i bought it . 
service[-3]##same story as everybody else when trying to get service from apex - nothing . 
##pay a few more bucks and get something else - it 'll be worth it in the long run . 
[t] best player for the buck . 
format[+2]##i was surprised to find that not only could this dvd player play mpeg2 format which allowed me to stack 2 movies on a dvd , but it also was able to play vob files which i created with smart ripper . 
aff[+2]##the aff feature did a great job converting the letterbox to fill 3/4 of the screen and the image still looked normal . 
design[+2]##loved the slim design . 
[t] black and white only after 1 month of use . 
color signal[-2]##this unit was working fine for the 1st month and a half and then the color signal disappeared . 
customer service[-2]##apex has still not responded to my email describing the problem after almost a week and their customer service line is always busy . 
[t] most bang for the buck. i recieved my 2600 4 days ago and feel that this may be the best $ 50 i have ever spent . 
##it plays all my back-ups , + or - , and everything else i have put in it without a hick up . 
audio[+2]##audio is excellent . 
##well worth the money . 
[t] for the price , an excellent buy . 
##after having bought and been disappointed in another brand of dvd player , i purchased the apex ad2600 from amazon and first of all i should say it was delivered much more quickly than i had expected . 
##( good going , amazon ). 
player[+3], format[+2]##i am very pleased with the apex ad2600.it plays just about anything you put in the drawer . 
##so far i 've played regular dvd 's , backup dvd-r 's , mp3 cd 's , and regular cd 's . 
##i have not yet tried the photo show capability , but i 'm thinking that will probably work well too , based on the success with the above mentioned disks . 
##i do want to mention too that it is certainly worthwhile to read the instruction manual that comes with the unit . 
##the comments i 've read about having problems with this dvd player all seem to stem from pushing the incorrect buttons on the dvd remote.for instance , pushing the button to play pal ( european type ) movies , when an ntsc ( usa type ) movie disk is in the disk tray . 
##so , if you read the instructions well , you should n't have any problems with this dvd unit . 
##i can 't speak to its long-term reliability , as i 've only had the apex ad2600 for a little over a week at this point . 
player[+2][p]##but , it seems to work so well now , that i do n't anticipate any problems with it . 
##bottom line for me is that for the price i do n't think you can go wrong at all by purchasing this dvd player . 
[t] excellent second dvd , or first dvd for hdtv ready tv. 
##wow ! 
player[+2][u]##simple to use and hook up . 
##comes with standard rca jacks for output , along with s-video output ( s-video cable not included , must be purchased seperately ) and also component video outputs . 
progressive scan[+2],remote[+3]##the progressive scan option can be turned off easily by a button on the remote control which is one of the simplest and easiest remote controls i have ever seen or used . 
##i also own an " apex ad 1201 " dvd player and have had no problems with it since i purchased it almost 1 1/2 years ago . 
##one big difference between the 1201 and the 2600 models is that the 2600 model is virtually silent . 
##and does n't need to be placed in a cabinet like the 1201 does . 
##friends of mine who own apex tv sets are also all very pleased . 
##i would not hesitate to purchase this if you are uncertain of the brand name . 
##consider it for a future gift too ! 
[t] save your money . 
player[-3]##this dvd play is basicly junk . 
play[-3][p]##it wo n't play all of my movies . 
##keeps coming up with no disk errors . 
customer service[-2]##i tried called apex cust service , no help . 
##do n't waste your money . 
player[-3][p]##mine was 2 weeks old and i chucked it in the trash , where it belongs . 
##this is the 4 apex player that i have bought . 
##you might think you are saving money by buying an apex but in the long run you will spend more . 
player[-2][p]##each of the 4 lasted less than six months . 
##you can get a pretty good progressive scan sony or toshiba now for 68 bucks just about anywhere . 
##spend the money its well worth it . 
[t] what a dvd player ! 
player[+3]##this is the best dvd player i 've purchased . 
##i 've owned a panasonic and sony dvd and this one outperforms in function and image quality and most of all , access speed . 
##for those of you who has problems with this player , i 'd suggest checking the owners manual to get the right setting so that you are not displaying the wrong mode and have no picture , etc. 
player[+3]##this player has worked flawlessly for me and at this price , you can 't go wrong . 
##80 % of the features on here you will not get by spending $ 100 on a sony or panasonic . 
##having said that , this is what you do . " add to cart " ! 
##" check out " ! 
##" enjoy " ! 
[t] apex ad2600 known capadabilty problem . 
play[-2], dvd[-2], no disc[-2]##i have sent my ad2600 back to apex because it wo n't play certain disney and other dvd movies ( no disc message ) . 
##they sent me a new ad2600 with the same problem . 
##i call apex customer service and they told me that there is a known problem with the model playing disney and other movies and that it is not there problem so i 'm stuck with a new dvd player that wo n't play my kids disney movies . 
[t] value for money ! 
##i bought this dvd player mainly because my old sharp dvd player could not play most of the dvds from the store that i rent from and i had to watch them using my pc 's dvd-rom player . 
dvd player[+2]##well , this apex dvd player turned out great ! 
media[+2][u]##it plays basically every media i 've tested so far , even an old vcd that i ripped years ago and the rental dvd that could n't be played on my old $ 200 sharp player ! 
user interface[+2]##i have to say i 'm also pretty impressed by the user interface for playing jpeg , mp3 and mpeg files stored on cd-rs / dvds . 
##it 's almost like having a media player / file manager built into the dvd player . 
player[+2]##i did not want to have high expectations for this apex player because of the price but it is definitely working out much better than what i would expect from an expensive high-end player . 
##what more can you ask for from a $ 40 dvd player ? 
##i guess i 'm just lucky to get a good working unit ! 
##hope the unit lasts as i 've only had it for 3 days . 
look[+2][u],panel[+2]##and the slim form-factor together with the mirror-like front panel sure makes the player look cool and pricey ! 
remote control[-2]##one bad thing though , i find the remote-control a bit flimsy and i predict it will most probably ' die ' before the player does . 
shipping[+2]##finally , amazon 's free shipping is really getting good , it took only 3 working days for the player to reach me ! 
[t] poor quality dvd player . 
player[-3]##i purchased two of these players for christmas gifts , and both were bad . 
player[-3]##the first one would n't work from the start . 
player[-2]##the second lasted about two weeks before the video went out ! 
##amazon.com promptly refunded my money for the first one , because a replacement was not available ( thanks amazon.com ! 
##i am still trying to resolve the problem with the second one . 
on-line support[-3][u]##i have tried several times to contact apex digital through their on-line support site and their telephone line , but they wo n't answer my emails and their telephone line is always busy . 
##i will never buy another apex digital product ! 
[t] you get what you paid for . 
player[+1]##for the most part this is a good dvd player . 
dvd[-2], picture[-2], play[-2]##but about 25 % of dvd 's i 've played on ithave a problem , when watching a movie the picture will freeze , but the dvd still plays , and eventualy the picture kicks back in after skipping a few moments . 
##usually i just skip to the next chapter to avoid it . 
##annoying . 
[t] no picture and / or no sound , try i/p button on the remote . 
product[-3][u]##we have had this product for over a month and yesterday it stopped working . 
##it is connected to an old television set via composite video and analog audio outputs . 
picture[-2], sound[-2]##there was neither picture nor sound . 
##connecting the same outputs to a video card in my computer , there was sound but still no picture . 
##the trouble shooting section in the user 's manual , suggesting correct and secure connections , does n't help . 
##i searched on the internet and found one tip which solved our problem : press i/p button on the remote control . 
##it makes the dvd player to switch between interlace mode and progressive scan mode . 
##obviously there is no composite video output and different analog audio signals at progressive scan mode . 
product[+2]##we are overall pleased with product . 
manual[-1]##i would have rated it five stars but for the poor manual . 
[t] people with video issue 's . 
##i think most of you people complaining about no video is due to you hitting the wrong button either the p/n = pal / ntsc or the i/p is set to progressive scan . 
##another stupid move . 
[t] buyer beware . 
##i purchased this as a christmas gift on 12-4 - 03 . 
picture[-3]##it worked from 12-26 to 1-9 at which time the picture failed completely ( see other negative reviews-my unit was n't the only one this happened to . ) 
support[-3]##i tried calling the support number for a week , several times a day , and always got a busy signal . 
##i also registered the unit online and posted two messages to the apex support person ( there can 't possibly be more than one ! 
support[-3]##neither message was answered ( they ask for 24 hours before replying - i 've been waiting 27 days . ) 
##i finally returned the unit to the company along with copies of my messages and return info . 
##let me quote a customer service rep from one of the authorized apex service locations in my state ( they only service apex tv 's , not dvd players ) : 
##" you can send it in , but i would n't count on ever seeing it or a replacement again . 
[t] barely worked . 
dvd[-2], read[-2], no disc[-2]##it only read the dvds 10 % of the time , otherwise i would get a no disc screen . 
##i got this dvd player as a gift and had to send it back . 
##amazon was supposed to send me another one , but did n't and sent me a gift certificate instead ( i 'm guessing because the price has gone up on this unit since december ). 
[t] has problems reading some dvds. 
##good : 
progressive scan player[+2],price[+2]##progressive scan player for a relatively low price ( although the better known manufacturers like toshiba , pioneer , and panasonic are now offering lower-priced progressive scan players as well ) . 
dvd[+2],sound[+2]##seems to read most dvds fine , and reads quietly ( i had a pioneer player that had fairly loud disc spin noise ) . 
read[+2], svcd[+2], vbr mp3 cd[+2]##also , i have not had trouble reading svcds that i created and vbr mp3 cds ( my old apex ad-1200 had trouble with these ) . 
output[+3]##output through component connections looks very good , on my non-hd tv . 
##bad : 
disc[-1], recognize[-2]##i 've had this player for several months and it reads most discs , but it would not recognize several discs that were clean and read on other players ( from friends season 2 ) . 
no disc[-2]##it would just spin up and stop , and display " no disc " . 
remote[-3]##my other gripe is the incredibly crappy remote , which is worse than other , cheaper apex units . 
##for some reason they made the navigation buttons all one button , a ring around the enter / play button . 
button[-3]##you have to press the buttons hard and frequently i end up pressing enter when i meant to scroll . 
s-video[-2]##also , for some reason the picture looks washed out on s-video , with lots of color bleeding , compared to a component connection ( should not be much of a perceptible difference on a 27 " tv ). 
[t] pretty good . 
##ok this is our first dvd player so what do i know . 
player[+2][p]##i checked out the amazon reviews and i 'm pleased to say mine worked , works , fine right out of the box . 
auto fit[+2]##i like the auto fit feature = you can stretch widescreen dvd 's to normal . 
##lot 's of other features that i need to find out about . 
look[+2][u]##looks ok - very shiny chrome and mirrors . 
##things that i 'd prefer different - there 's a red light that shines when it 's turned off ! 
remote[-3]##and the remote is cheap and cheasy - not sure how long it 'll last , but for 50 bucks what the heck ! 
[t] plays pancakes . 
play[+2][p]##this thing plays everything i feed it . 
##compusa , memorex , fuji . 
##plays them all . 
##i ordered 2 . 
[t] great dvd player . 
##i wanted a dvd player that had basic features and would be able to play dvd - r format disc 's that i had made myself . 
format[+2][u]##when i 1st tried it i found that it had no problem playing the more expensive dvd - r media disc 's that other players would play but to my surprise was able to play cheep media that i had burned that i could n't get to work before in anything but the dvd burner itself that i had made the disc with . 
use[+2], size[+2],look[+2]##easy to use , small form factor , and looks good to boot . 
##very happy ! 
[t] customer service is non-existent ! ! 
##i wish i could give negative stars ! 
##i bought this dvd player in november . 
##i have an apex ad600 for a few years now which still works great today . 
##i figured with a great first product and with this one having more features than the 600 i would buy one . 
##what a mistake ! 
player[-3][p]##after about an hour it starts skipping like the dvd 's are dirty . 
##i 've tried several dvd 's and even new ones do the same thing . 
no disc[-2]##i have ice age and it keeps telling me no disc . 
##i 've tried someone elses and the same thing happens . 
customer service[-3][u]##i tried e-mailing apex and they come back saying undeliverable . 
customer service[-3][u]##i 've tried leaving questions on their site never to have them answered . 
##i just want to at least try an exchange but you can 't get through to their number , it 's always busy . 
##that makes sense though , with all the substandard products they make . 
##do not buy this product or any apex product unless you are looking to be frustrated and lose money ! 
[t] keep shopping , do n't stop here . 
##i bought this as a gift for my sister . 
player[-3][p]##it has never worked . 
player[-3]##i 've attempted to connect this unit to several different tvs , using a multitude of connection methods , and i still can 't get a video signal from the machine . 
##i highly regret trying to save a few $ with this purchase . 
[t] worst customer service on record . 
player[-3][u]##purchased the ad-2600 about a month ago and have had numerous problems with it . 
on/off button[-2]##the most recent is that it will stop responding to the on/off button . 
##the light goes from red to green but no display or any operation whatsoever . 
##i end up unplugging it from the wall for a few hours and when i try again it will work fine.at least until this problem arises again . 
##i 've registered this unit at www.apexdigialinc.com and listed the problem . 
customer service[-3][u]##they claim to respond in a 24 hour period yet it 's been 2 weeks without a reply . 
customer service[-3]##i 've sent 10 e-mails to their customer service department requesting an ra with no response . 
##i 've called the service number and if it 's not busy , it rings forever then eventually dumps you . 
##once i actually got to an answering machine and left a message . 
##still no response . 
##i will never purchase anything from this company ever again and have logged my complaint with the bbb . 
[t] good price , bad product . 
##i bought this player as a christmas present for my wife . 
player[-3]##3/4 way through the first disk we played on it ( naturally on 31 days after purchase ) the dvd player froze . 
player[-2]##now it will not load any disk or just says that there is no disk . 
customer service[-3][u]##have tried to contact apex via e-mail ( customerservice@apexdigital.com ) , but the e-mail address is not valid . 
customer service[-3][u]##have tried calling ( 866-4apexgo ) , but can 't get through . 
player[-3][u],customer service[-3]##this product sucks , the customer service from apex sucks . 
##i should n't have been cheap , should have bought a toshiba . 
[t] stay away from it . 
##i bought this product from amazon . 
play[-3]##after using it for just a month , i could not play any dvd . 
picture[-2]##i can only hear the sound but no picture ! 
customer service[-3]##their customer ( www.apexdigitalinc.com ) service is very poor . 
##no contact phone number , only eamil contact which did not respond me . 
[t] problems . 
##i bought this player during a christmas sale at an excellent price . 
##however , i should have followed my instincts : 
##you get what you pay for . 
dvd[-3]##one of the dvd 's i received as a christmas present kept freezing . 
dvd[-3]##some dvd 's i rented would not play . 
##now , i suddenly have no picture . 
##i will say this . 
player[-2]##when the player was working it was great ,but . 
[t] the second apex - at least it 's prettier than the last . 
##the physical appearance of this apex compared to one previous ( ad1100w ) is most appreciated . 
##the prior one looked and felt lightweight , cheesy , and assembled by the oppressed : 
##i purchased it for it 's easy ability to accept cd-r hacks . 
##i used it lightly , and it lasted just over one year ( forgot to kill the power one day , and now it only plays dvds ). 
##back to the 2600 : 
##1 . 
smell[+1]##it does n't smell like burning plastic when you open the drive . 
##2 . 
look[+2]##without a doubt the finest looking apex dvd player that i 've seen . 
##3 . 
picture quality[+3]##excellent picture quality - on par with my pioneer , panasonic , and jvc players . 
##4 . 
remote[+2]##remote : you can stand it on end ( harder to lose ) , and it 's far better designed than the 1100s . 
##anyway , the initial impression is much better than when i opened the box on the 1100 over a year ago - you can telll that apex is trying harder to improve their product . 
##i 'd have given it 5 stars , but i 'm waiting to see if this one holds up to more frequent use than the last one : 
##with progressive scan , i expect it to play play play - and give my old pioneer a rest . 
[t] does not play dvds with extra features .. . 
dvd[-2]##first of all , i bought this dvd as a christmas present for my girlfriend and i am somewhat disappointed . 
player[+2]##unlike some of the other people who received a " lemon " , my dvd player came in perfect working condition . 
design[+2],player[+2]##as a whole , the dvd player has a sleek design and works fine . 
dvd[-2]##what disappointed me is the fact that it does not seem to read certain dvds . 
read[-2]##for example , i tried playing my new " pirates of the carribean " extra features dvd , but this dvd player can not read it . 
read[-2], dvd[-2]##at first i thought it is only a isolated incident , but i was proven wrong when the player would not read my " alias " dvds as well . 
player[+1]##this player seems to work fine with everything else . 
##so i do n't understand why it would not work with dvds that seem to have more features in them . 
player[-2][u]##because of this , i am disappointed and would not recommend this product . 
[t] apex you can trust . 
##i had apex regular ( non-progressive ) dvd-player for two years . 
##had no problem with it . 
##now , i thought it 's time to upgrade . 
##so , i bought apex ad-2600 in november ' 03 from amazon . 
run[+2], dvd[+2]##it 's running great for all the dvds i have and rented . 
##i have a dvd burner . 
run[+3], dvd media[+2]#apex ad-2600 runs all the dvd media including dvd + r/rw and dvd-r / rw ( unlike sony or panasonic - one supports only + r/rw and another supports - r/rw ) . 
dvd player[+3]##i think , apex is the best dvd player you can get for the price . 
##some of my friends had well branded dvd-players but they keep complaining that sometime it stucks and sucks ! 
apex[+2]##most of them are already switched to apex and they are happy . 
##if you are skeptical about trying apex . 
##take my words and give it a try . 
##hopefully you wo n't regret . 
##goodluck ! 
[t] a great discovery ! 
##i bought this to replace an expensive ( $ 300 + ) onkyo dvd player that quit after only 3 years ! 
player[+2][p]##this has so many capabilities that you 'll always have room for new technologies as they evolve . 
sound[+3],picture clarity[+3]##i use this with a home theater system and it 's amazing how it sounds , the picture clarity is unmatched ! 
case[+2],price[+2][u]##so much packed in a small case and very affordable ! 
[t] sucks . 
##worked for two weeks . 
picture[-3][u]##after two weeks the picture kept freezing . 
##spend the extra 20 $ and buy a name brand dvd player . 
apex[-3]##apex sucks ! 
##only the cheap and poor would buy one . 
[t] video failed after 3 weeks . 
player[-3][u]##unit worked great for 3 weeks then video output failed . 
[t] quirky ? 
##i got one of these to serve as a second dvd player in my house . 
size[+1],machine[+2]##it 's a compact , attractive machine and was easy to set up . 
usage[+1]##basic usage is easy , but the remote has a lot of buttons that i have n't used . 
player[+2][p]##so far , we 've only used this player a few times to watch movies and it has worked fine . 
picture[+2],sound[+2]##the picture is clear , bright and sharp and the sound is good . 
##again , though , it has only been used sparingly . 
read[-2], disc[-2]##the catch is that , while it plays movies just fine , it has refused to read second discs with the movie " extras " on them on the two occaisions when i tried to do that . 
##it 's not a big deal for me . 
##i simply watched the extra features on another player . 
##had this been my only dvd player , though , it would have been a real problem . 
##as it is , i 'm keeping the machine . 
player[+1][p]##it works well enough ( so far ) for me to be satisfied with it , and it 's possible that i 'm missing something . 
##but i would expect that , since my movie discs have all played with no problem , the extras discs would , too , without any additional tweaking . 
player[+1]##i 'm giving this player cautious recommendation . 
player[+2][p]##there are a lot of things i like about it . 
##be advised , however , that you may encounter problems . 
[t] apex ad-2600 working so far . 
picture[+2]##received apex dvd and the picture was great when set up with s connector . 
remote[-1]##the remote is a little hard to understand . 
jpeg picture[-1]##my jpeg pictures are viewable ( not so sharp and vivid ) on my 27 " screen but seem not as clear as when i view them on my 17 " monitor . 
dvd[+1]##so far the dvd works so i hope it does n't break down like the reviews i 've read . 
##prior to christmas , it seems the reviews were very good but after that it seems the reviews went bad ! 
##i would n't gotten this dvd based on the reviews i read after christmas . 
[t] great player ... when it worked ! 
video output[-3]##video output stopped workin . 
video output[-3]##this was an awesome player , before the video output no longer worked ( after about 3 weeks ) . 
##i might have gotten a lemon , but this is not the first report of video output failure on this machine . 
##i am returning it , and again in the market for a multiformat dvd , svcd , vcd , mp3 , etc. player . 
player[-3][u]##what a disappointment ! 
[t] quit in 10 days . 
##i bought the apex ad-2600 dvd player for the family for christmas . 
set up[+1],player[-2]##set up was easy and we enjoyed it for just over a week . 
lip-sync[-1]##there was occasionally a lip-sync issue ( the lips were n't moving in time to the dialogue ) . 
video[-2]##but after 10 days , the sound worked , but the video quit working . 
amazon[+3]##amazon was wonderful about picking it up the next day and paying for the return shipping . 
##perhaps this experience will teach me not to buy " off " brands . 
[t] read the manual ! ! 
##i 'm editing my review , because now i wish i read the manual before returning the player i bought for my girlfriend . 
##the button on the remote to switch from pal to ntsc was undoubtedly my problem . 
##now i may buy two ! 
##( my orignal review is below : ) 
feature[+2],reliability[-2]##great feature list , poor reliability . 
output[-2]##output went black and white only via both s-video and composite connections , and with no v-hold . 
##thankfully amazon has free return shipping ! 
[t] retraction : said mine had silver plate : it does have display . 
display[+1]##retraction : said mine had silver plate : it does have display . 
player[+2][p]##it works great . 
##i should have looked at it harder . 
[t] great by for the price . 
##i purchased two apex 2600 for christmas presents . 
##so far we have only hooked up one of them . 
unit[+3], format[+2]##the unit seems to play all formats that i have put in it ( jpeg , kodak pic 's and dvd-r ) i have read other reviews and some good and soom not so good , but my feeling at this time is " two thumbs up " ! 
##( i guess only time will tell ? ) 
remote[-1]##p.s the remote control does seem to get confused at times and doesnt respond but it may be just operator error ? 
[t] does n't play my alias season 1 dvds . 
player[-3][u]##what the hell is wrong with this thing . 
##i bought this thing because it plays everything . 
##this is the third apex dvd i bought . 
##the first one was the 705 which i hacked successfully to play all region dvds and disable macrovision . 
##the second one was the 2500 which i think is better than the 2600 because it has more features such as karoake which i do use sometimes for parties . 
##but heck it plays my alias dvds . 
##what the heck is up with the 2600 . 
##it suppose to play everything . 
##wrong ! 
##by the way my alias dvds are legit too not no bootleg from the internet . 
##i 'm sending this pup back to amazon and looking for the 2500 on ebay . 
##you should too . 
play[-2], dvd[-2]##forget about the sleek looks if it can 't play some of your real dvds. 
[t] only lasted a month ! 
##i bought the 2600 because it plays everything ! 
video output[-3]##well , within 45 days the video output quit working ( both rca & optic ) . 
video output[-3[p][u]##so now it still plays everything , you just can 't see it ! 
[t] a frustrating christmas . 
##we ordered two apex ad-2600 's for our family for christmas - finally decided to join the rest of the world and watch dvd 's - well . 
player[-3][p]##the first one we installed did n't work , and our kids were devastated to say the least . 
##the second one is up and running . 
player[+1][p]##it seems to be working fine , but we 've not used it all that much . 
##i am returning the broken one today . 
##i will not be ordering another one to replace it . 
player[-3]##update : january 27th 2004 - the second one crapped out only after a week - dont buy this product ! 
[t] disappointing - get what you pay for . 
look[+2],feature[+2]##the player looked good right out of the box , offering lots of features and good styling . 
dvd[-3]##i immediately had problems getting the player to recognize two of my favorite dvds . 
##after " loading " for what seemed like a very long time , the display indicated " no disk " . 
video[-2]##after multilple tries , one of the disks was finally recognized but video was poor and features not available . 
disk[-2]##only one disk played through to completion successfully . 
##at $ 49 . 
##i guess you get what you pay for . 
##i 'd recommend against this unit . 
[t] this dvd player ruined christmas - twice ! 
##i ordered two of these puppies for christmas gifts . 
player[-3][p], motor[-2], disc[-2]##when we tried to hook up the first one , it was broken - the motor would not eject discs or close the door . 
##strike 1 .
player[-3]##when i tried to install the second dvd player in my brothers house , that one didn " t work either ! 
apex[-3]##imagine my shock - and absolute instant disdain for any products made by apex . 
power supply[-2]##the 2nd dvd player had a faulty power supply which caused to occasionally not turn on . 
##do not recommend . 
[t] let the countdown begin apex . 
##what can i say , i bought the ad600 2 years ago and it was probly the best dvd player ever , quality design , stable , plus it uses a standard ide interface so you can use an old dvd drive from your computer if the player dies . 
##in the last month i bought the apex ad-1600 and the ad-1220 . 
##and have returned both . 
ad-1600[-3], ad-1220[-2]##the ad-1600 did n't work corectly from the start and the ad-1220 lasted about a week and a half before it started to act up . 
##my recommendation is to wait on buying one from this company as they will surely get sent a message of many returned dvd players after christmas 2003 . 
##i hoping they will then begin building quality dvd players again , as i do like them . 
##it really does n't make any cents $ $ to build a great reputation then destroy it from lack a research and testing in one season . 
amazon[+3]##amazon is awaesome ! 
##they refunded my $ $ $ so fast and paid for the shipping back . 
##what more could you ask for . 
[t] price vs performance . 
dvd player[+2]##for the price , it 's a very nice dvd player . 
door[-1]##the front door is miss aligned on my unit and you have to manually life it up just so slightly for the door to close , a very annoying thing after ahwile . 
format[+3]##it does play a wide range of formats as advertised which is very nice . 
dvd[+1]##and so far have not had any problems with dvds not being able to play . 
##recommended to anyone looking to purchase a low priced dvd player and not expecting any bells or whistles from a brand name one like sony . 
[t] my first dvd player and i 'm well satisfied ! 
##i finally joined the 21st century and bought this dvd player . 
##i knew nothing about dvds before this but with this machine i figured it all out very quickly . 
feature[+1]##i only wanted something to play dvds on but this machine has all these other features that i probably will never use but it 's nice to know that there 're there . 
size[+2],weight[+2]##the machine is very light and slim and fits nicely into my tv stand . 
player[+3][u]##i 've had no problems at all so far and i 'm very happy . 
##i applied a $ 25 amazon gift voucher i got for christmas so i only ended up paying $ 29 for this machine . 
##even if i had paid full price i would have considered this a good deal . 
[t] when it works , it 's great , when it does n't it 's frustrating . 
##bought the apex ad-2600 from amazon in 12/03 mainly on price , $ 49.99 - $ 10 rebate = $ 39.99 . 
##that was a mistake . 
dvd[-2]##we tried the " finding nemo " dvd and when we got to ~ chapter 28 , the frames started to freeze for no reason . 
##cleaned the dvd , tried again , no luck . 
##i pulled out our old non-progressive scan toshiba , hooked it back-up and the " finding nemo " dvd works fine . 
##i agree with previous posts that you get what you pay for . 
player[-2]##i can 't rate it one star only because when it does work it 's pretty good . 
player[-2]##only owned it about two weeks so i expect we 're looking at getting another progressive scan dvd player of higher quality very soon . 
[t] i will give it one more try ! 
##i purchased the ad 2600 from another company last month and was very satisfied with my purchase , until last night . 
##i was watching pirates of the caribbean and decided to watch the extras disc . 
player[-2], no disc[-2]##the player kept displaying " no disc " , so i tried the disc in another machine and sure as @ # * ! 
##it worked . 
##i even went as far as calling the technical support number on the disc . 
##the person i talked to suggested i take the dvd player back and swap it out with another . 
##the other company is currently " out of stock " so i ordered another from amazon and will be taking the original back to the competitor today . 
##hopefully the replacement from amazon will work just fine . 
##if not i will avoid apex products in the future . 
player[+2]##besides the one problem , this machine is amazing ! 
play[+3][u]##it plays everything , even vcd 's . 
##if only it played stand alone avi files . 
##if no problems occur with replacement unit i will keep the 4 star rating . 
##if problem occurs again i will repost my new rating . 
[t] well worth the money . 
player[+3][p]##i will never use all the " whistles and bells " this machine is capable of . 
player[+3][p]##but for what i do use it is perfect . 
##i was , however . 
##somewhat disappointed that i could not " hook up " to my sony multi brand remote commander . 
##small problem . 
[t] apex and remote control . 
##hi , many people are saying , " you get what you pay for , i guess . " 
##well that is not true . 
##you could have paid more and got a lot less . 
##i paid $ 49 and now it 's $ 125 ! 
##you have to ask yourself , " how much money is dissapointment worth ? " 
##because , you will be dissapointed . 
##then you can say , " my dissapointment only cost $ 39 . " 
##i think a $ 39 dissapointment is better then a $ 125 dissapointment ! 
##so , without further adoo . 
freeze[-2], player[-2]##1 ) frame freezes and the family yells , " dad ! somethings wrong with the dvd player ! come quick ! " 
remote[-2]##2 ) the remote works , but then it does not work , and you are left standing there thinking you are doing something wrong . 
##3 ) you must press the play button and hold it for a couple of seconds otherwise it will not work and you will think the whole unit is broken . 
##4 ) it did play my jpeg photos but wow , trying to figure it out was really something ! 
universal remote control[-2]##5 ) this apex model 2600 will not work with my universal remote control . 
##i dare you to surf the net and find the code . 
##you will be told goldstar codes work , and you will be told zenith codes will work , and radio shack will give you apex codes but they will not work . 
code[-2]##finally you will read a post somewhere that all codes are useless for the apex 2600 . 
##and then you will start to belive them . 
##if this is your fist dvd player . 
##save yourself some aggrivation . 
[t] keep your receipt . 
##bought two ad2600 's for christmas . 
player[-2]##one still works fine , the other quit after one day . 
manual[+1]##owner 's manual has substandard troubleshooting guide . 
customer service[-2][u]##apex 's website is down and they wo n't answer their phone . 
[t] isacc l. fisher was wrong . 
player[+2]##the dvd player is fine . 
##to get back to the menu of the dvd you have to press " menu " on the remote while the dvd is playing . 
##if the dvd is stopped , it will display " playback only " . 
##little inconveinent , but unlike other players i only paid 40 $ . 
[t] fantastic dvd player for the price . 
##i purchased one of these to replace an ailing dvd player that 's a few years old . 
player[+3][p]##of course , i was hesitant given the price , but i 've been extremely impressed since receiving it , and bought a second one as a christmas present for my parents . 
picture[+3]##the picture is perfect , although i 'm not watching on an hdtv . 
loading[-2][u]##it seems to be a little slow when identifying a new disc that 's inserted - maybe 10 seconds of wait . 
##also , if you 're an audiophile , you 'll want to get your own cables because the supplied ones are thin and short . 
player[+3]##but , dollar for dollar , this dvd player is probably the best out there . 
[t] lots of sound but no picture ! 
##i bought this for my dad for christmas . 
picture[-3]##when i hooked it up it only produced sound - a cd played fine , but with a dvd i only got the audio - no picture ! 
##let 's face it - when you want to watch a movie you want to see a picture . 
##as i travelled internationally and did n't want to haul it back on a plane with me it was an expensive addition to the recycling bin . 
##had to buy my dad a different dvd player locally ( panasonic ) which worked just fine . 
##save your cash - go for a brand that actually cares about their reputation . 
[t] looks great , works like crap . 
##bought one for $ 49.99 . 
dvd[-3],cd[-3], no disc[-2]##seemed like a good deal , but this pos frequently cannot recognize dvds and music cds -- takes a long time loading and then concludes , " no disc " . 
##sent mine back . 
##i 'd look elsewhere . 
[t] awkward remote ; flimsy build quality . 
dvd player[-3]##granted , i have only used this dvd player for about 2 hours setting it up for my mom for christmas , but that was long enough for me to find problems with this dvd player . 
menu[-2]##first , the player did not allow me to access the menus of dvds . 
##when i hit " menu " it told me , " playback only . " 
##i actually had to re-open the drawer and close it to get back to the dvd menu . 
menu[-3][p]##this is extemely lame . 
remote[-3]##the remote is flimsy-feeling and awkward to use . 
remote[-1]##in addition , it only seems to work if you 're about five feet away from the player , although that may have been just the batteries that came with it . 
dvd[+2]##the player does seem to play dvds adequately enough . 
##it also has an optical out , which it should . 
##i think for about $ 40 more , you can probably find a much better dvd player than this though . 
[t] a very embarassing gift . 
##i purchased the apex 2600 after reading good reviews of it , both here and in other places . 
player[-3][u]##after less than 24 hours it turned out to be a huge disappointment , for myself and for my parents , for whom it was a gift . 
dvd[-2]##it played only one out of three dvd 's without problems , the other two being afflicted by a number of glitches . 
dvd[-2]##both of the problem dvd 's would repeatedly freeze during playback , while the counter on the player kept going . 
speed[-3]##one also exhibited extremely slow speed when going to the menu . 
##these problems were consistent , and also not present on another dvd player . 
door[-2]##the dvd door would scratch the top of the disc every time it closed . 
size[+1],remote layout[+1]##there were a few attractive features , such as the small size and the layout of the remote . 
player[-2]##all in all , trying to save some money on this player resulted in me shelling a great deal more when i purchased a much nicer dvd vcr combo player to make up for blazing crappiness of this very embarassing gift . 
[t] great - for the first three hours . 
player[-3]##i was impressed by this very inexpensive player.for the first three hours , and then it died . 
##i was told that it is no longer available , so there must be something really wrong with it . 
[t] you get what you pay for . 
player[+1]##i looked into buying an inexpensive dvd player that had more than the standard set of features and this item seemed to be the best in that category . 
player[+1][p]##i just hooked it up and everything seemed to be going fine . 
noise[-1], external display[-2]##there are a couple of quirks that were a bit annoying like having to actually press the power button before the tray will open ( my prev. machine did it automatically ) , and the fact that the external display is too small and too faded to read from any significant distance . 
look[+2],feature[+2]##still , i was willing to overlook those things as this unit looks sleek and has a myriad of features ! 
##so i pop-in my first dvd and start to watch . 
freeze[-2]##i get to chapter 34 and everything freezes ! 
##ok , that happens , so i try to skip the chapter . 
##nothing ! 
player[-3][p]##i try navigating to a chapter past 34 via the menu and it would n't do it ! 
player[-3][p]##i try navigating using the player 's built in menu , and it still would n't work ! 
##my next thought was that the dvd must be damaged . 
##upon inspection i did find a small scratch on the surface and figured that to be the cause . 
##i decided to check one more thing though and plugged in my 3-year - old unit again just to see . 
##the dvd played without flaw through the chapter in question . 
##i then played it through my ps2 and there was no problem there either . 
##guess where this unit is headed ? 
##yup , right back for a refund ! 
[t] more trouble than it 's worth times 10 . 
##i was so excited about the price and reviews of this dvd player . 
##i am even a bit technology oriented , so i thought it would be a breeze to set this up . 
dvd[-3], read[-2]##unfortunately , the player would not read any of my region one dvds. even though they were not damaged in any way . 
support[-3]##i called apex 's support number numerous times but it just kept ringing . 
##i hope that amazon will let me trade it for a different , more trusted brand of dvd player . 
[t] value for money . 
dvd player[+3]##this is probably one of the few dvd players at $ 40 that can play almost everything you throw at it . 
##the plus points are - 
##1 . 
##price 
##2 . 
format[+2]##ability to play most discs - i tried dvd , vcd , dvd-r , audio cd and it played all 
##3 . 
look[+2]##good looks 
##the downside - 
##1 . 
quality[-3]##the build quality shows why its so cheap - small scratches on the base plate , something that you would n't see on a sony and an overall plasticky feel 
##2 . 
remote button[-2]##remote buttons are small and closely spaced , especially with the menu buttons . 
##if these otherwise minor issues can be fixed , i would rate this a 5 star machine . 
[t] great cheap buy ! 
player[+2]##this is wonderful to have for your first dvd player . 
player[+2]##i brought it for my sister in college and she loves it ! 
apex[+3]##apex is the best cheap quality brand for dvd players . 
weight[+2]##also , very light and portable . 
[t] apex 2600 . 
dvd disc[-3], read[-3]##the one i purchased for a frend as a gift will not read any dvd disc . 
read[+2], cd audio disc[+2]##it will read and play all cd audio disc . 
##guess i will return it for an exchange and hope for the best with the new one . 
##so far not going to get a good review . 
##a disipointed customer . 
[t] hit and miss . 
amazon[+3]##i have shopped with amazon before and have been very happy with their performance thus far . 
##i received the apex ad-2600 before i expected . 
##that is where my satisfaction ends . 
##i bought the apex ad-2600 because of the ability to play jpegs and it seemed like it was the most bang for the buck . 
quality[-2]##however , it has failed to deliver on quality . 
jpeg[-2],dvd[-2]##it does not only have difficulty playing jpegs , it even has trouble properly playing dvd movies . 
no disc[-2]##on several different occasions it has displayed " no disc " with a disc inside . 
##after reading several other reviews this appears to be relatively common . 
apex[-1]##i read in consumer reports that apex is a reliable brand , but with my experience and reading the other reviews , i think i will be doing a little more homework before considering another apex product . 
##i am returning mine for a replacement , but if i receive another ad-2600 with the same or similar problems i will not only return it for a refund , but never buy another apex product in the future . 
##i guess you get what you pay for . 
[t] the ad2600 had false silver plate instead of play display . 
silver plate[-2]##the 2600 had false silver plate instead of play display . 
##the case had ad2600 . 
##bait and switch . 
##picture on web site clearly has the play display pictured , yet false silver plate . 
##what is up . 
##clearly a large lawsuit if i were so inclined . 
##i feel that once i contact amazon that they will get to the bottom of this . 
[t] moderately impressed . 
##i just got it today and have tried to verify the claims of other reviewers . 
##no go on most formats . 
play[+2], cd[+2], mp3[+2], jpeg[+2]##it plays original dvds and cds and plays mp3s and jpegs . 
play[-2], windows media[-2], divx rip[-2]##however , it does not play windows media and i can not get it to play any of my divx rips . 
##i guess that i can not complain since it does not actually claim to play vcd / svcd formats , but others say they can . 
player[+2]##also , it was only $ 39.99 ( after rebate ) with free shipping and no tax so overall it is a decent player . 
video quality[+2]##good quality video . 
[t] apex ad-2600 compatability . 
##bought this player after reading the reviews here which identify it as reading most formats including dvd + rw 's and vcd 's . 
read[-2], dvd[-2], vcd[-2]##can 't say whether i rec 'd an " updated " model but it will not read dvd + rw 's or vcd 's for me . 
play[+2], dvd-r[+2]##it did play a dvd-r which was unplayable in my older philips machine . 
##i do n't have a dvd + r to try 
##so . 
price[+2]##mixed bag i guess but the price was right . 
[t] great budget player . 
price[+3]##this is the third apex product i 've bought and they continue to impress for the price . 
##it goes nicely with my apex 27 " in my bedroom . 
build quality[+2],picture[+2],sound[+2]##the build quality feels solid , it does n't shake or whine while playing discs , and the picture and sound is top notch ( both dts and dd5.1 sound good ) . 
##i paid twenty dollars more than the current price , and even then it was a steal . 
[t] fantastic bargain ! 
##hooray ! 
##think you need to pay a fortune for a good qulaity dvd player ? 
##well , not with this one . 
look[+3][u], player[+1][p]##it looks really sleek and stylish , and does everything it claims . 
format[+1]##i tried as bunch of different formats to see if it would play and it did . 
product[+3]##i am very pleased with this product and the price to match and have n't had any problems . 
direction[+3]##there are really easy directions for setup and fiddling around with the picture , zoom etc . 
dvd player[+2]##so sit back , relax and brag to all your friends who paid a mountain of money for a dvd player that can 't do half the things this one can , and for a fraction of the price ! 
##only problem , if you think it 's going to be delivered in the 24hrs amazon claims , do n't hold your breath . 
##otherwise it 'll get there the day you get back from the hospital ! 
[t] value value value . 
sound[+1],weight[+1]##noiseless , lightweight and oh yeah . 
work[+3], player[+2][u]##works great ! 
color[+2]##silverish color really adds a special touch . 
##who cares if it does n't have multiple slots ? 
format[+2]##it plays just about any format ( check before you buy if it plays yours . ) 
##if you watch dvds once in a while like i do , get this ! 
##apex is made in usa and is one of the underrated brands out there . 
##if you watch one dvd per weekm its yours . 
##however , i do n't know the dvd 's performance on a heavy load of every-day viewing . 
price[+2]##either way , can 't go wrong with this price . 
[t] plays anything . 
dvd player[+3]##i am really impressed by this dvd player . 
##if it can fit in the drive bay , this dvd player will play it . 
play[+2], dvd[+2]##for instance , i made several back-ups of my dvd movies using dvd-r ( w ) and + r ( w ) and it plays the dvds . 
format[+3]##no matter the format . 
##awesome ! 

[t]excellent picture quality / color 
canon powershot g3[+3]##i recently purchased the canon powershot g3 and am extremely satisfied with the purchase . 
use[+2]##the camera is very easy to use , in fact on a recent trip this past week i was asked to take a picture of a vacationing elderly group . 
##after i took their picture with their camera , they offered to take a picture of us . 
##i just told them , press halfway , wait for the box to turn green and press the rest of the way . 
picture[+2]##they fired away and the picture turned out quite nicely . ( as all of my pictures have thusfar ) . 
picture quality[+1]##a few of my work constituants owned the g2 and highly recommended the canon for picture quality . 
picture quality[+1]##i 'm easily enlarging pictures to 8 1/2 x 11 with no visable loss in picture quality and not even using the best possible setting as yet ( super fine ) . 
##ensure you get a larger flash , 128 or 256 , some are selling with the larger flash , 32mb will do in a pinch but you 'll quickly want a larger flash card as with any of the 4mp cameras . 
camera[+2], use[+2], feature[+1]##bottom line , well made camera , easy to use , very flexible and powerful features to include the ability to use external flash and lense / filters choices . 
picture quality[+3], use[+1], option[+1]##i 'd highly recommend this camera for anyone who is looking for excellent quality pictures and a combination of ease of use and the flexibility to get advanced with many options to adjust if you like . 
##great job canon ! 
[t]cool toy
##yep . 
camera[+2]##this is my first digital camera , and what a ' toy ' it is ! 
##i am a software engineer and am very keen into technical details of everything i buy , i spend around 3 months before buying the digital camera ; and i must say , g3 worth every single cent i spent on it . 
picture[+2]##just a little overview , powershot g3 is the flagship of canon 's powershot series and its an slr-like camera , its 4 megapixel and ( alsmost ) full manual control gives the pictures a touch of brilliance . 
use[+1]##whether you are a novice or an expert , its ease of use and functionality goes together . 
##+ you can have different kind of lens if you want + flashes , etc. 
##as its 4mp , you might need bigger storage to store high quality images and recording movies ( you can record 3 minutes of video ) . 
##i am using kingston 512mb cf which works great and is very fast . 
##a good choice could be cf type ii , microdrives that can store around 1 gb of images . 
##some things that i did n't like ( but hey . nothing is perfect ). 
dial[-1]##* main dial is not backlit . 
viewfinder[-2]##* lens visible in optical viewfinder . 
##( well thats only for old-school die-hard optical viewfinder fans ) use lcd instead which is brilliant and you can twist around too . 
camera[+2][p]##overall i 'm happy with my toy . 
[t]canon g3 ? incredible camera 
##i did extensive research comparing different 4 and 5 megapixel cameras . 
##a couple of online camera review sites were extremely helpful , as they provided complete exhaustive reviews of nearly every camera made , plus provided a great number of high resolution sample images to compare amongst the models . 
##following my research , i decided on the g3 . 
camera[+3]##in a word , " awesome " is how i would describe this camera . 
speed[+2],picture quality[+2],function[+2]##i wo n't go into the details here , as the online sites ( stevesdigicams , dpreviews ) go into great depth in their reviews , but i am very pleased with the features , the speed , the picture quality , the flexibility , the automation , and the functional conveniences this camera offers . 
auto setting[+2]##with the automatic settings , i really have n't taken a bad picture yet . 
##and with the panoramic " stitch " mode , it guides you through stitching together multiple pictures to build a seamless panoramic image . 
camera[+3]##i am absolutely in awe of this camera , canon put enormous quality into the g3 . 
##do n't walk , run and buy this camera if you have the budget , i guarantee you will not be disappointed . 
[t]great camera 
canon g3[+3]##i bought my canon g3 about a month ago and i have to say i am very satisfied . 
photo quality[+2]##i have taken hundreds of photos with it and i continue to be amazed by their quality . 
feature[+2]##the g3 is loaded with many useful features , and unlike many smaller digital cameras , it is easy to hold steady when using slower shutter speeds . 
##flaws ? 
viewfinder[-1]##the lens is visible in the viewfinder when the lens is set to the wide angle , but since i use the lcd most of the time , this is not really much of a bother to me . 
##still i am a little suprised that canon did not correct this design flaw before releasing the camera . 
camera[+2]##despite this minor disappointment , i highly recommend the canon g3 anyone who is serious about digital photography . 
[t]have n't had practice but i 'm already in love with it 
camera[+2]##i have only had this camera for one full day and i have to say that it is wonderful . 
photo quality[+3]##the photo quality is amazing and i know i 'm going to have fun with all the features . 
##i 've figured out most of its features on my own already ( because i have used digital cameras before , so i know things like symbols ) . 
##i 'm one of those people that can only concentrate on one screen at a time so i 've been having trouble paying attention to the little display panel on top , but that does n't stop me from loving this camera . 
darn diopter adjustment dial[-1]##the reason i rated it a four is because of that darn diopter adjustment dial. its very small and hard to turn so you can 't get an accurate adjustment ( for those of you who do n't know what a diopter adjustment is , it is to adjust the focus of the viewfinder to your eyesight . ) 
##i am going to have so much fun with this camera and when i learn more i will post a more accurate review . 
[t]excellent for the semi-serious amateur 
##positives 
exposure control[+2],auto setting[+2]##1 ) slr like programming and exposure control gives you latitude to be creative , yet its progam and auto exposure settings provide excellent photos if you do n't want to bother with the settings . 
metering option[+2]##excellent range of metering options as well . 
spot metering[+1]##it 's great to switch to spot metering and actually see it working on the lcd screen . 
4mp[+1]##2 ) 4mp is about right for the target market of this camera ( semi-serious amateur photographer ) 
zoom[+1]##3 ) 4x zoom is nice 
##4 ) the great thing about digital , in general , is that you can generally see the results of your exposure settings on the lcd screen before you take the picture , not two weeks later when you get the film developed . 
focus[+2]##5 ) its focusing system is also very flexible . 
focus[+2]##you can move the focus range to almost anywhere in the scene with the push of a button , and it has an on-screen manual focus mode that would be really helpful if shooting a scene that is tough to automatically focus . 
##negatives 
size[-2][u],weight[-2][u]##1 ) quite bulky ( it 's about the same size as my minolta vectis s-1 aps slr ) and uses a heavy battery , although not very solid as it is contructed mostly of plastic ( unlike canon 's elph line ) 
design[-2][u]##2 ) not very ergonomical - you 'll find even for a point-and-shoot lens ) 
viewfinder[-2]##4 ) the viewfinder is borderuer lcd scoying . 
[t]fantastic digital camera 
feature[+2], ##the camera has a wonderful set of features . 
lcd[+2]##the lcd screen pulls out and rotates in any direction for easy pictures . 
##you can even take a picture of yourself while looking at the lcd . 
optical zoom[+2],digital zoom[+1]##the optical zoom works great and the 14x digital zoom is a very nice addition although pictures at the highest digital zoom are a little blurry . 
picture[+3]##the highest optical zoom pictures are perfect . 
picture[+3]##i have not yet seen any of the usual problems with digital pictures ( purple fringing , etc ) so i am very pleased . 
software[+2]##the canon computer software used to download , sort , upload and manage your digital pictures on the computer is very nice and very easy to use . 
lens cap[-1],viewfinder[-1]##the only two minor issues i have with the camera are the lens cap ( it is not very snug and can come off too easily ) and the lens itself ( it partially obstructs the view through the viewfinder but not views through the lcd ) . 
menu[+1],button[+1]##the menus are easy to navigate and the buttons are easy to use . 
camera[+3]##it is a fantastic camera and well worth the price . 
[t]the best of everything 
camera[+3]##recent price drops have made the g3 the best bargain in digital cameras currently available . 
control[+2]##advanced photobugs will find more creative control than imaginable . 
auto setting[+2]##newbies will find the full auto setting will give them perfect pictures right out of the box . 
photo quality[+3]##4 megapixels is enough for anybody and the photo quality is awesome . 
##do n't get fooled by the 5 megapixel marketing hype . 
##unless you want to print murals , you do n't need it . 
use[+2][u]##those used to 35mm cameras will find the g3 very comfortable and friendly to use . 
##anyone looking for more than " point and shoot " can make a huge step up for a moderate price difference . 
zoom[+2],lense[+2]##the extended zoom range and faster lense put it at the top of it 's class . 
##i expect the g3 will please me for years to come . 
[t]pure class & quality - a work of craftmanship 
camera[+3]##i recommend unreservedly the powershot g3 to any potential buyer looking for a first-class digital camera at a reasonable price - there is no better camera out there - period ! 
picture[+3], control[+2], battery[+2], software[+2]##it gives great pictures , the controls are easy to use , the battery lasts forever on one single charge , the software is very user-friendly and it is beautiful in it chrome casing . 
photo quality[+2], auto mode[+2]##i began taking pics as soon as i got this camera and am amazed at the quality of photos i have took simply by using the auto mode . 
##absolutely breathtaking . 
##i was considering the olympus camedia c-5050 but was convinced to buy the g3 after visiting a store and holding it in my hands and trying it out . 
##the olympus is a bit clumsy-looking and the user-interface not as friendly as the canon , but one of the features that sold me on the g3 was the battery life - no other camera out there gives you the type of battery life as the canon g3 . 
##i would recommend a larger compact-flash card , at least 128 mb . 
##i bought a 512 mb card by simpletech and it works great with my canon . 
[t]great camera 
##what else can you say about a camera that works for both of you ? 
##i make photographs at work , and so wanted a camera good enough to compare with what i use professionally . 
##at the same time , i wanted my wife to not be intimidated by knobs and buttons . 
##i recieved the camera , inserted a larger cf card , charged the battery , and handed it to my wife . 
##i showed her how to turn it on , where the lens zoom lever is , and she loves it ! 
canera[+2]##this camera has canon 's great colorimetry , plus what you see in the lcd is what you get . 
print[+2]##the prints are beautiful ! 
##and you get about 120 images on a 256mb card at highest quality . 
##i tried out some other brands in the stores , and was disappointed by the battery life of the other company ; plus what you see in the lcd ( no optical finder ) is n't what you get - not even for color ; the output was less than i expected . 
battery[+1]##although canon 's batteries are proprietary , they last a really long time , recharge fairly quickly in the camera , plus if you want ' more power ' , you can even find a knockoff charger and spare batteries right here on amazon . 
[t]if you love an slr 35mm but need to go digital 
camera[+2]##this is a great camera for you ! 
control[+2],auto mode[+2]##the canon g3 gives tons of control for photo buffs but still has an " auto " mode that makes it very easy for the novice to use . 
##i can hand this to anyone and know they will take some great photos ! 
control[+2]##i love having the option to manually control the f-stop , shutter speed and even focus . 
photo[+3]##i was able to take great photos of the 4th of july fire works , and got some amazing shots of the kids playing with sparklers . 
##warning - i did read the manual ! 
control[+2]##but if you 've used a slr 35mm camera , the controls are very intuitive ! 
##once i read the manual i was able to point and shoot without having to fumble around trying to figure out where the controls are located . 
dial[+1]##with a quick spin of the dial you can select shutter priority ( for high speed subjects ) , aperture priority ( for focal length ) or full program mode where the camera selects both for ideal photo quality . 
manual mode[+2]##the manual mode is easy to use with fast access for the selection of shutter speed and aperture without having to fumble through menu options . 
##it does n't do you any good if a camera has all the features but you can 't access them quickly when you need them ! 
feel[+2],weight[+2]##this camera also has a great feel and weight to it . 
feel[+2]##you feel like you are holding something of substance , not some cheap plastic toy . 
camera[+2][p]##the more i work with it , the more i love it ! 
##i would recomend that you purchase a lexar media cf for the camera as the sandisk card that comes packaged is too small and too slow ! 
camera[+3][u]##i did n't think i would find this quality and ease of use for under $ 1500 - i 'm thrilled with my purchase ! 
[t]outstanding camera 
camera[+3]##this is my first digital camera , and i am very pleased with it . 
##i do not know a whole lot about photography , but i am happy to know that this camera can always perform , even as i grow in skill and knowledge . 
camera[+2][u]##seriously , this thing has everything that a pro or expert amateur could want . 
picture[+2], auto mode[+2]##but at the same time , it takes wonderful pictures very easily in " auto " mode , so that even an average joe like me can use it ! 
four megapixel[+1]##four megapixels is great . 
##i know there are five mp cameras out there , but this thing does just fine for me . 
##if you want , check out the canon website and they have some sample images , taken by this camera , for you to download . 
##if you are looking for a very simple point and shoot camera , this is probably not what you are looking for . 
##if you are looking for an outstanding camera that can take you from simple to complex , this is it . 
product[+3][u]##it is a very amazing product . 
camera[+3][p]##i highly recommend it . 
[t]love my new g 3 
feature[+2]##just received this camera two days ago and already love the features it has . 
photo[+2]##takes excellent photos . 
night mode[+2]##night mode is clear as day . 
use[+1][u]##i have not played with all the features yet , but the camera is easy to use once you get used to it . 
viewfinder[-1]##the only drawback is the viewfinder is slightly blocked by the lens . 
##however , using the lcd seems to eliminate this minor problem . 
camera[+3]##overall it is the best camera on the market . 
##i give it 10 stars ! 
[t]noise level 
##this camera has significantly more noise at iso 100 than the nikon 4500 . 
[t]the pictures are brillient 
##i just bought the camera a few days ago . 
##before i " get used to it " , here are my first feelings : 
picture quality[+3]##a ) the picture quality ( color and sharpness of focusing ) are so great , it completely eliminated my doubt about digital imaging --- how could one eat rice one grain at a time : - ) ) 
lens cover[-2]##b ) the lens cover is surely loose , i already accidently finger-printed the len a few times , and au lens tigt and cause potential damage . 
##i wish canon would work out some way for that issue . 
zooming lever[-2]##the zooming lever is shaky , i hope it does not operate mechanically , otherwise you 'll feel uneasy . 
[t]great gadget 
##i bought this last week through amazon . 
##got a great deal from a reputable seller . 
camera[+2]##i love this camera . 
##i am still trying to figure out the may options it has . 
picture[+2]##took hundreds of pictures and they were great . 
color[+2],picture[+2],white balance[+2]##great colors , pictures and white balance . 
optical zoom[+1]##has 4x optical zoom which is higher than any other in the same price range . 
##it is generally overpriced a little bit but you get what you are paying for . 
[t]ok for a digital camera 
picture[-3][u]##maybe it is my lack of experience , but i found shots with this camera very disappointing . 
price[-3][u]##it was ( i sold it after a few months ) too expensive for the shots that i got . 
camera[-2][u]##sure it had all the features , but when i tried to shoot a girl 's basketball game it just wan't up to the task . 
##i do n't think i was asking too much . 
##any film zoom p and s would have given superior results with a minimal effort . 
##and with the 500 you save you could print the results for the life of the camera . 
camera[-3]##i found that low light situations combined with any sort of action left this camera in the dust . 
##i wanted it to shoot concerts as well . 
##that meant even less light and just as much action . 
##sure , i adjusted the film speed to 400 . 
grain[-3]##the grain was terrible . 
##next time i set it at 100 and used the flash . 
flash photo[-3],noise[-2]##well flash photos are never great , and there was still a lot of noise . 
photo[+3]##when i took outdoor photos with plenty of light and the objects were n't moving , the photos were awesome . 
camera[+1]##the camera was a marvel . 
##getting the printer to help output them was another tale . 
##overall i think that you need to consider what you wan't to do . 
##for simple point and shoot photography , consider a cheaper digital . 
##you do n't need the extra resolution or the cost . 
##then again a one time use camera may do just as well . 
##if you shoot in lots of light and desire high quality , this will be your camera . 
camera[+3][p]##it is versatile and seems to be one of the best . 
##me , i am going with a leica minilux ( the g3 was replacing mine which was stolen ) . 
##sure . 
##it is less versatile , but i am never disappointed with the output . 
[t]within its limitations 
##i am a long-time user of highly responsive film slrs and professional quality external flash equipment , just so you know my bias . 
##i have been watching the development of digicams for years , waiting to make my first move . 
##what i really want is a $ 1,500 digital slr with a full frame sensor that will take my nikon lenses . 
##i figure that is at least three years off , and i am getting impatient . 
##hence i decided to spring for a point-and-shoot digicam that that would have features that would let me get around their inherent limitations . 
g3[+1]##i chose the g3 because of its reputation for very high quality , clean images . 
lag time[-2],flash[-2]##the two limitations i knew i would have to deal with are the very long lag time before it focus-locks ( even in bright light ) , and the unsatisfactory light quality of the built-in flash . 
##as of this writing , technology has not solved the focus-lock lag time problem for point-and-shoot digicams and anyone who is satisfied with it simply has never used a modern film slr . 
##at least once youve got focus lock , the shutter release lag time for the g3 is about 1/10 of a second , which from what ive read , is better than just about anything else available . 
depth[+1]##what makes the focus-lock lag time something i can live with is the extreme depth of field obtainable with these point and shoot digicams at f8 . 
##once i get focus lock , i can then wait until my restless subject ( a pet or a child ) strikes an amusing pose and then fire the shutter with some reasonable probability of getting my subject still in focus . 
##now what about the flash problem ? 
flash[-2]##relative to what i can easily achieve with external flash on my nikon slr , the internal flash on the g3 produces harsh , flat images with ugly hot spots . 
external flash hot shoe[+1]##fortunately , the g3 has a hot shoe that can take an external flash , and fortunately for me , i already owned a one of the highest quality external flashes that money can buy : the metz 60 ct-4 . 
##i cant use my nikon external flash on a canon camera , but i can use my metz , with the proper metz module and extension cord connected between the g3 and the 60 ct-4 . 
##for those who have this metz flash ( or the 45cl-3 ) and would like to get the absolute ultimate quality out of this g3 , the metz module you need is the sca 3102 and the connector cord is the sca 3000c . 
##in order for this to work , you have to set the camera to manual mode and set the shutter speed and f-stop yourself . 
flash[+2]##contrary to what ive read elsewhere , the g3 does sync at 1/250 of a second with third-party flashes , just as it does with the dedicated flashes from canon . 
##you also have to set the g3 to second shutter sync , which is what youd want to do most of the time anyhow . 
##then just forget about all the controls you have on the metz flash head itself and the sca 3102 control panel , because they are all ignored . 
##the g3 completely takes over controlling the duration of the metz flash , and most of the time , the exposure is spot on and when it isnt , its because youve exceeded the range of the metz flash itself . 
##this might happen if you get too close to the subject and you are not bounce-flashing , or if you are bounce flashing and the walls are simply too far away . 
##unfortunately , the neutral density filters for the metz flash are no longer available , so the first problem cant easily be solved . 
##the second problem is solved by more direct lighting from the metz ( with the attendant shadows unfortunately ) . 
##but once youve got your exposure within an acceptable range , the g3 is shown to produce utterly stunning images that i can hardly get with my nikon f100 film camera . 
##the 60 ct-4 flash head can actually be reversed 180 degrees and then tilted , enabling you to bounce the flash off the walls behind you . 
##the results are shadow-free images that look as if theyve been exposed with the gentlest natural light you could imagine . 
software[-2]##now there is one more complaint i have about the g3 and that is the software that comes with it for processing raw images ( i only shoot in raw image mode and the first thing i did was replace the 32 mbyte cf with a 512 mbyte cf , which gives me 130 raw images , as opposed to 7 ! 
software[-2]##the canon software for raw images does not present you with a raw image at all , but the raw image after it has been processed by all the image-affecting settings in the camera . 
##i believe this is enabled by a second file that comes out of the camera that stores all this information . 
##maybe if you delete those files before you looked at them with the software , youd see the true , raw image that the camera actually produces . 
##i didnt wait to experiment . 
##instead , i bought the adobe photoshop camera raw plug-in . 
g3[+3]##what this plug-in reveals is the truly stunning quality of the raw g3 hardware . 
color[+3]##without any tweaking at all , if the exposure is accurate , the colors are as realistic as ive ever seen produced by film , and this is a raw image ! 
g3[+3],software[-2]##the adobe camera raw plug-in shows once again that hardware is miles ahead of software . 
software[-2]##what the g3 raw image software gives you is a fantasy world designed to please the uncritical . 
##what the photoshop plug-in gives you is reality , and then if you want fantasy , you can use photoshop to create it . 
image[+3]##but at least youre starting with the most photorealistic images ive ever seen from a camera . 
raw image[+3]##i am stunned and amazed at the quality of the raw images i am getting from this g3 ( in conjunction with my professional flash system ) , and can easily put up with the cameras limitations , because ive never seen anything better within its resolution limits . 
[t]knock your socks off great 
camera[+2][p]##i 've had this for 3 months now , and i am pleased with my decision . 
camera[+3]##this is the perfect camera for a photo hobbiest who wants to have easy point and shoot ability as well . 
##my girlfriend loved using this camera so much as a point and shoot that i had to pry it out of her hands most of the time . 
battery life[+1]##battery life , the drawback to most digital cameras , to quote k. reeves . 
##whoa . 
manual function[+2],picture quality[+3]##manual functionality is excellent , downloading pictures is quick and a breeze , and the quality is astounding . 
##i did a good month 's worth of research before buying this over other similar priced digital cameras , and this is the best buy for the buck . 
viewfinder[-1],lcd[+2],camera[+3]##not perfect ( yes , the viewfinder can get obstructed in instances.but the lcd works well enough in those instances ) , not the cheapest 4.0 mp , but the best 4.0 mp . 
##if you do n't believe me on that , check the consumer reports review as well as the many digital camera review sites out there . 
##or save time and just do it , you wo n't regret it . 
[t]great digital camera 
##after reading the very positive review of this camera in a leading consumer magazine , i decided to head here , to amazon , to read through the online reviews . 
##the objections of the naysayers almost caused me to purchase a different camera , but , in the end , i figured i 'd give the g3 a try . 
##i 'm very glad i did . 
service[+3]##the service from the supplier was exceptional . 
##the camera arrived on time and in perfect condition . 
photo[+3]##having used it for more than a month , i can say that it consistently produces topnotch photos . 
##recently , i attended a " flyball " competition 
##-- an event that involves dogs running and jumping hurdles . 
photo[+3]##by cocking the shutter to the halfway position and getting the settings ready to shoot , i was able to produce excellent stopaction photos -- contrary to what other reviewers experienced . 
automode[+2],manual mode[+2]##the camera is a dream to operate in automode , but also gives tremendous flexibility in aperture priority , shutter priority , and manual modes . 
##in the coastal redwood forests i was able to use these additional features along with the macro-focussing option to shoot wonderful close-up photos of the trilliums and other flowers in bloom . 
viewfinder[-2]##about the only legitimate criticsm from the online reviews is that fact that the lens really does obstruct the viewfinder . 
##this effect is increased when one buys and uses a telephoto doubler . 
##but who cares ? 
##i always shoot using the lcd panel . 
camera[+3]##i can 't write enough positive things about this great little camera ! 
[t]canon never ceases to amaze 
##being a great fan of the g2 i set out with g3 with a somewhat negative expectation , difficult as it is to improve drastically on something already as ' perfect ' as the powershot g2 . 
canon[+3]##but canon never fails to amaze . 
##some of the great gains over g2 -- 
raw format[+2]##1 . the ability to selectively switch to raw format during record review gives you incredible more post-processing flexibility . 
battery life[+1]##2 . battery life is over 4.5 hours , compared to about 2.5 hours for the g2 or the 2 hours for most nikons . 
software[+2]##3 . the remote capture and fileviewer software bundled for photo capture is mind-blowing . 
##looks sort of like picasa software ( google it if you dont know ) in the interface and is as easy to install and operate as g2 's , but more intuitive . 
shape[+1]##4 . the shape of this device is a little squarer , without losing the weight which means better balance and less shaking while clicking . 
##a big plus in my book . 
##5 . the 1/200 sec , f5.6 + nd filter for highly exposed ( or very brightly lit ) environments . 
light auto correction[+2]##the light auto-correction is awesome . 
picture[+2]##you could take a picture of a stone glinting in the sun and still avoid the shining glaze and get the contours right . 
##6 . the g2 's " color effect " exposure mode has now been removed , the replacement is a selectable " effect func " menu option available in all exposure modes . 
##there are six default settings ( off , vivid , sepia , neutral , low sharpening , b & w ) as well as a ' custom effect ' that allows you to control sharpening , contrast and saturation . 
##7 . a new photostich software for stiching your pics into a panoramic view . 
##i can of course buy such a tool off the shelves separately but helps if it comes with my camera . 
##( looks quite neat too suggesting that canon may have , er , canonized it a bit ). 
white offset[+2]##8 . perhaps inspired by the canon 's factory white-correction settings ( which were found lacking and had to be altered by a user before the white edges from buildings etc could be cleaned out ) , the g3 has much sharper white offsets . 
##in english , this means that even straight out of the box , you 'll be amazed at the pics you end up taking . 
##9 . in dim lit environs the g2 could easily outperform any other camera , and thankfully g3 maintains this rep . 
##personally i believe it even outperforms the g2 in terms of less haze and astonishingly real colors . 
g3[+3]##overall , the g3 delivers what must be considered the best image quality of any current > 4 megapixel digicams , from a detail , tonal balance and color response point of view . 
##there 's really very little about g3 images to criticize . 
##short of the eos range from canon or the d100s from nikon ( both slrs ) .
camera[+3][p]##this is quite simply the best you can ask for . 
[t]love the g2 
##i love my g2 so thought i would upgrade . 
##big mistake . 
low light focus[-2]##the g3 had problems focusing in low light and would not take the picture when the shutter was pressed but after the shutter had been released a few seconds . 
picture[-3]##got way too many blurry pictures . 
##i have returned the g3 ( actually i tried two of them ) and have my g2 ! 
[t]awesome pro-sumer camera 
##when shopping for digital cameras i looked at the nikon cp5700 , olympus c5050 , nikon cp5000 , and the canon g3 . 
##yes , all cameras except g3 were 5mp but i was looking for a lot more than just megapixel power . 
##not only was i was shopping for a camera that would suit my casual and artistic photographic needs , i had to keep in mind that my fiance wanted to use this camera as well . 
##her main focus was having a camera that is easy to understand and use . 
##the nikon 's are great cameras . 
##+ they have great optics ( cp5700 has great optical zoom ) and features , not to mention take great pictures . 
##- the drawbacks were that they were not user friendly for the casual photographer , the lcd screen is a little too small , cp5000 does not take photos in raw format . 
##olympus c5050 is a very solid camera with a metal body . 
##+ takes sharp 5mp photo 's , has great features and relatively easy to use . 
##- i did n't care much for the tilting lcd screen , it seemed very limited and not very usefull . 
##photos had some artifacts and noise . 
##my fiance just did n't like the way it felt in her hands . 
##we also looked at the fuji fps602 . 
##nice camera but does n't take as sharp as pictures i thought they would , and again . 
##fiance did n't like the feel . 
##the canon g3 . 
photo[+3], use[+3], software[+2]##4mp , 4x optical zoom , takes absolutely beautiful photos with detail that challenges all of the above 5mp cameras , easy to understand and use ( has a great swivel lcd screen ) , a lot of features and add-on options , comes with great software ( not to be overlooked ) , and last but by far not least , received my fiance 's stamp of approval ( two thumbs up ! ) 
##a lot of research went into digital camera 's before i made this purchase , and hands down , the g3 had everything i needed plus more . 
##the other cameras were great and i 'm sure many people will beg to differ from my observations , but to each his / her own . 
##i have no buyers remorse with this baby , and i never will . 
##always remember , cameras do n't take great pictures , people do ! 
[t]upgraded from g2 and not looking back 
camera[+2]##the powershot g3 is a great camera . 
##why ? 
photo[+3]##because it can help a so-so photographer take spectacular photos ! 
camera[+2]##4 megapixels is plenty for all but pros , and you will not be disappointed with the results of this camera . 
feature[+1]##it 's slightly lighter than the g2 and packed with even more features . 
##make sure you get a big compactflash card ( it comes with a 32mb ) -- the 512mb cards are pretty [ inexpensive ] here on amazon.com and can hold about 500 photos at a time ! 
[t]the catch 
unresponsiveness[-2]##the catch with the canon g3 camera , ( and perhaps all of digital cameras ) is that its unresponsiveness will cause you to miss precious shots . 
##prior to the purchase , none of my digital camera friends mentioned the delay between pressing the shutter button and the camera taking the picture . 
##no one told me , but i wanted to tell you . 
##this is not the same thing as a film camera . 
##and while it is cool and fun and has no film processing costs . 
##they have n't got all the bugs worked out just yet . 
##most of the time , my g3 is a well-behaved camera . 
##but once in a while , i run up against it 's major flaw : 
delay[-1][u]##it sometimes takes the picture at some indefinite period of time after you press the shutter button . 
##i am not talking milliseconds . 
##picture this : 
##your child is going to do a cannonball off the diving board , so you compose the shot and wait for your moment . 
##when it arrives , you press the shutter release . 
##splash ! 
##the moment passes , and then your new g3 camera takes the shot . 
##perhaps there is a way around this delay . 
##some feature i could turn on or off , or some attachment i could get . 
##yes , i push the button down halfway first to avoid the autofocus delay . 
##yes , i have red-eye off , and yes , i 've tried adding a flash . 
##but after trying many adjustments , the camera remains unresponsive when compared to any film-based camera . 
##i own another canon - an eos ( 35mm film ) camera . 
##it focuses in a snap . 
##dim or bright , it would never take a picture after the birthday candles had blown out , after the tae kwon do kick broke the board . 
delay[-2][u]##canon 's g3 does it consistently . 
focus[-2], shoot[-2]##it feels slow to focus , and unbearably slow to shoot . 
##i challenge anyone ( who is not in direct sun at the beach at noon ) to say it is fast and responsive . 
##and so i must ask , what are cameras for ? 
##what task do they perform ? 
##cameras capture moments . 
##they stop time . 
##because once the moment is gone , it is not coming back . 
##the dive , the kick , the blow-out-the-candles moments are , to me , the reason for cameras . 
##a 35mm film camera captures the moments you want , while these digital cameras ( my friends now inform me ) all seem to capture the moment immediately following the one you asked to capture . 
##not all the time , but often enough to be a real problem . 
##like i said , when the moment is gone , it is gone . 
##so buy the g3 . 
##buy it for fun , for lack of processing , because you want to use iphoto , or whatever . 
##but do not assume , as i did , that the g3 has the same ability as [ your current film camera ] to stop the moment you choose . 
##from a dime store disposable to a top of the line eos , all film cameras share this ability to capture the moment you tell them to . 
g3[-2]##unfortunately , this digital moment-capturing device called the g3 sometimes captures the moment after the one you wanted . 
[t]100 % happy 
camera[+3]##this is my first digital camera and i could n't be happier . 
##i have but plan on selling my rebel ti and all of the equipment with it . 
picture quality[+2]##i love the quality of the pictures . 
picture quality[+2][p]##they look fantastic . 
##i can take better pictures with this then my rebel ti with a good lens . 
##it 's just easier for me since i can make on the fly adjustments . 
[t]the best 4mp out there 
4mp camera[+2]##the canon g3 is perhaps the best 4mp camera out there . 
##i 've tried the sony s85 with the carl zeiss lens , but the pictures were too digital . 
picture[+2]##with canon , you get pictures that appear to be photos , not still camcorder shots . 
control[+2],menu[+2]##i love the eos based controls and easy menus . 
##i do n't need to go into exhustive review of this camera . 
##many before me have done that already . 
##i agree with the positive reviews . 
##but there are two things i do n't like about the camera that were not mentioned in any previous reviews . 
lens cap[-2]##1 ) the included lens cap is very loose on the camera . 
##though the instruction booklet says that the camera should display " lens " when the cap and the camera are both on , the camera lens extends out and simply takes the lens cap off by itself . 
##i 'm concerned that with the easily removed lens cap , i may damage the lens . 
##very cheaply made . 
body[-2]##2 ) the body construction - buttons , casing , etc , are too plastic . 
##the g2 was better in this respect . 
casing[-2]##it had a heavier and more sturdy casing . 
##despite these grieps , i still recommend the camera . 
[t]love it more and more 
##i used a canon powershot s20 for about 2.5 years and loved it ! 
##there were a few flaws that i learned to deal with and took thousands of pictures around the world , losing a few that i really regretted . 
##i finally decided to upgrade , and started my research . 
##canon was an obvious choice , but i did not want to limit my decision , so started researching all brands that would take my microdrives . 
##i researched , held , tested , and observed 3 different brands . 
##needless to say , the canon won , hands down . 
##this camera performs like i can not believe ! 
performance[+3][p]##i bought it for my trip to beunos aires , and also used it at the iguazu falls , and could not have asked for more perfect performance ! 
##it was too new to have learned much about the advanced features , so i generally used the auto mode . 
camera[+3]##this camera is worth every penny , and i highly recommend it ! 
battery life[+3]##another point of note : the battery life is incredible ! 
##i did not have a backup battery , and had no need for one . 
##i did have ability to charge it every night , so do n't know how long it would have actually gone before dying . 
##this camera will stay with me for years ! 
[t]the last digital camera i 'll buy 
##i 've been looking to buy a digital camera for a long time and v = finally decided that now was the time . 
##after a lot of research , i decided on the g3 . 
camera[+2]##am i ever glad that i decided on this camera ! 
camera[+2]##i 've only had it a week , but so far , everything about this camera is making me happy . 
##forget the fact that it 'll probably take me a year to figure out all the features this camera has to offer . 
##i 've been able to change modes on this thing without even looking at the manual . 
menu[+2]##very intuitive menus are a big plus on this camera . 
##i charged it up the day i got it , took a bunch of pictures and i do n't think the battery indicator has budged from fully charged . 
battery[+2]##the standard battery include with the g3 is a camcorder battery that will allow me to take pictures all day without worrying about charging . 
##i was worried about this after seeing a friend change batteries on his olympus after about 20-30 pictures . 
optical zoom[+3],viewfinder[+1]##the optical zoom is awesome , and the viewfinder reflects the settings of the zoom . 
viewfinder[-2]##one little minor flaw with this camera is that the lens is visible in the viewfinder , but does not detract from the image at all . 
##as i said , this is the last digital camera i 'll buy , and if you are in the market one , my advice is to buy the best thing you can afford and keep it forever . 
##these things may get a lot better in the future , but from what i 've seen in the last few years , the technology for digital cameras is n't advancing at the pace of pc 's , phones and hard drives . 
camera[+3]##the best 4 megapixel/4x optical zoom camera available and fairly easy to use . 
##highly recommended . 
##for more info on digital cameras , go to dpreviews . 
[t]boxy ? no -- gorgeous 
##you can read the other reviews for specs and performance opinions . 
##i was perfectly happy with my g2 , so why did i trade up to the g3 ? 
camera[+3]##because this camera is beautiful . 
##the g2 was slightly curvy with a champagne finish -- very homely . 
look[+3]##the g3 looks like a work of art ! 
finish[+3]##its silver magnesium finish is stunning , and the sharp lines and excellent grip are better than any other camera i 've seen . 
##the little digital elphs were the best-designed , most-elegant cameras until the g3 came along and squashed them . 
[t]very good choice in it 's price range 
##this is my first digital camera . 
camera[+2][p]##i am very pleased with it so far . 
##i wanted something that is able to take high quality photos but not be so bulky that i would wind up leaving it at home all the time . 
##this seemed like a really good compromise . 
##i compared it to the olympus c5050z , the sony dcs-f 717 and the nikon 5700 . 
##based on the cameras features and about dozen online reviews , this one seemed like the best all round deal . 
##it is not perfect though . 
##here are the shortcomings i have noticed so far : 
##it would have been a much easier choice if this were 5mp camera . 
viewfinder[-2]##you can see the lens barrel in the view-finder . 
tiff format[-2]##( i knew this before hand , and it is not that bad ) there is no tiff format . 
##that would be a nice compromise between jpeg and raw . 
##to save a picture as raw , you have to have the display on , this seems like a waste of battery power . 
lag[-2]##it seems to me that after the focus and metering are complete there is quite a lag before the shutter ? 
##trips . 
##( again this is my first digital camera and maybe that is just how they all are . ) 
##for those of you using a mac in os x+ there is no twain utility to download your pics directly into photoshop . 
import[+2]##it is very simple to import via iphoto 2 and then move them to photoshop . 
##i have not spent much time with the included software , so i don't know what to say about it other than it seems ok . 
camera[+2]##i am quite happy with the camera . 
manual[+2]##it comes with a clearly written manual and the learning curve is not too too steep . 
camera[+2][p]##yes , i recommend it over the competition . 
[t]best of the best 
camera[+3]##best camera ever . from the image quality , color , function , i can say almost everything . 
stitch picture[+2]##this camera has a cool stitch pictures feature , to find out more just log on to canon 's website . 
##i had an olympus digital camera before and it was nothing compared to this . 
##for those of you who already bought this camera , i suggest you buy a hi-ti dye-sub photo printer . 
[t]you 'll take more pics 
##i do n't write many reviews but i 'm compelled to do so with this camera . 
picture[+2]##first and foremost , it will take better pic 's than most film camera 's . 
##save them on computer and print out just the ones who want . 
##duplicates are a no brainer and cheap . 
##no more wasted time and money developing rolls of pic 's for just a couple of keepers . 
##crop and enlarge the best at practically no extra cost or time . 
##the technology is finally here folks , to make your photo life easier . 
##a great new use for that underutilized computer . 
##a digital camera will stay at home if its a hassle to use . 
##poor quality pics , short battery life , slow time consuming uploads and printing will ruin the digital camera experience and keep you buying film . 
camera[+2]##this camera has none of these flaws and will be something you 'll use all the time . 
##my wife shuns all new technology and compained when i brought this home , but now she 's forever asking for the digital camera . 
##and i let my kids shoot as many pics as they want , let them review them on the camera and just print the good ones ( which are not many ) . 
##get the canon 850 printer and an ex flash . 
##in short , i have a new slr with an expensive lens and several film point and shoots . 
##i have n't used any of them since i got the g3 . 
##unless your a professional , now you will need only one camera . this one . 
[t]excellent camera 
##i spent a lot of time comparing different cameras , and i realized that there is not such thing as the best digital camera . 
##you can always spend more money to get a better one . 
camera[+3]##however , for a $ 600 - $ 800 budget , i think this camera is an excellent choice . 
design[+2], feature[+2],use[+1][u],battery[+2]##it has a beautiful design , lots of features , very easy to use , very configurable and customizable , and the battery duration is amazing ! 
display[+2]##also , the display is " hinged " and it can be placed in a myriad of positions , or to protect it against any damage . 
##excellent idea ! 
compactflash[-2]##one bad thing is that it comes with a pitiful 32mb compactflash card , and for most purposes , it is not enough . 
##however , it seems that this is the general rule for most digital cameras . 
noise[+2]##another good thing is that this camera seems to introduce much less noise in dark places than others i 've seen . 
[t]cannon 
camera[+2]##i have owned this camera for a short time and would n't give it up for anything . 
camera[+2]##it surpasses my greatest expectations in a 4mp camera .. 
[t]powerful product 
##bought this product about a month ago and have used it in a variety of situations . 
use[+1][u],design[+1][u]##in general it is easy to use and well laid out . 
##for `` cool factor '' buffs it looks and feels like a small plastic brick brick and does n't have any wow factor . 
use[+3],control[+2]##it makes up for this by being extremely easy to use with well laid out controls that can be learned quickly . 
feature[+2]##the g3 has most if not all of the features that you would want from a semi-pro / pro slr with a good range of manual options for those who know something about photography . 
auto mode[+1]##in the hands of someone who does n't , it will yield good results on idiot program / auto mode . 
##my wife , who has never used a camera before , picked it up and soon got the hang of the fact that if you do n't like what you have created you just delete and try again . 
##the photos she took are better than the results i got from my nikon slr and range of lenses ! 
##this is a big plus for those who a shifting to digital and the g3 's large mobile screen helps with this . 
##negative points : 
memory card[-2]##the included memory card is too small . 
##go out and get a 256meg card , it 's worth the expense . 
made[-2]##it is made of plastic . 
##for those who are used to brass cameras that can be dropped , picking up a camera like the g3 is an unnerving experience . 
##this is by no means unique to this model , i 'm sure . 
lens[-1]##the zoom lens unit feels fragile and it is worth buying a good camera bag if you are going put to carry it round a lot . 
##this is not a handbag camera . 
size[-1][u]##while light , it will not easily go in small handbags or pockets . 
lever[-1]##the function lever - the one which switches between capture and view mode feels fragile . 
flash[-1]##flash - as with all built-in flashes in small cameras , you get overilluminated main subjects with depth being lost . 
##the g3 has a shoe which will take other powerful ( and expensive ) canon flashes that will allow bounce and reflected flash photography . 
strap[-2]##the strap is horrible and gets in the way of parts of the camera you need access to . 
##if you can afford this camera , you can afford to get a better strap elsewhere - a very minor quibble . 
##good points : 
camera[+2]##the functionality on this camera is mind-blowing . 
option[+1}, control[+1]##canon have packed a lot in here and the options and controls are easy to use and logically laid out . 
learning[+1]##learning how to use it will not take very long . 
image quality[+3]##the image quality is excellent . 
##messing around with images in photoshop ( a supplied software package ) and printing them on a good printer , yielded excellent results . 
##unless you are making posters , a g3 is more than good enough . 
function[+1]##range of functions - as indicated above - it has something for everyone : point and shoot power plus advanced functions for those who are serious about photography . 
##please note that this is the first digital camera i have owned or used . 
##a lot of my opinions are more relevant for those who are switching from film . 
##i did extensive research before chosing the g3 but there 's nothing like picking one up and playing with it first . 
[t]best camera i 've used 
camera[+2]##this is by far the finest camera in its price and category i have ever used . 
##it is also one of the few electronic items that works right out of the box . 
macro[+2], auto mode[+2]##the macro works great for medical photographs and the auto mode is terrific for point and shoot . 
[t]this camera is closest to perfect than any otherdigicam 
camera[+2]##this camera is closest to perfect than any other digicam that is 4-5 megapixel . 
##beats that sony f717 ; its archrival . 
4mp resolution[+1]##i 'm glad canon decided to keep the 4mp resolution and improved upon it with new technology ; 
##i can 't fit all that resolution ( 4mp = 2272x 1704 resol . ) in my 19in flat monitor ( 1200x1024 resol . ) anyways . 
##please go to read dpreview.com and you 'll get the complete story . 
##my story is based on personal usage . 
distortion[-1][u]##yes there is a corner lens barrel distortion ( i do n't like it too but no harm done since i always use the camea lcd screen to see exactly what i 'm going to get ) in the viewfinder when you do n't zoom ( when you zoom the lens distortion goes away ) , canon knows this and engineered it that way to minimize the parallax phenomenon ; that is what lmost exactly ot the picture . 
##moving the viewfinder elsewhere on the camera will remove the lens distortion but increase the parallax phenomenon . 
##the distortion is not a flaw . 
##as with taking digital pictures , i notice other people including myself have errors on their compactflash which results in certain shots being partially taken or lost - this is an issue that seems to effect compactflash and other digicam brand . 
##i 've have n't heard about a diagnos or fix for this . 
shot[+2]##in terms of the shots taken , this camera is insanely great ! 
picture[+3],learning curve[+1]##the pictures are fabulous and their is a ( short ) learning curve to it ; there are tons of features i have n't even gotten to . 
##in terms of the important accessories , i got myself an the extra litium battery . 
##based on my used , 1 full charge was enough for at least 255 shots . 
##i also got myself a 512mb viking compact flash ( enough for 255 shots at full 4mp resolution and max picture quality ) and a used $ 250 3lb subnotebook with usb connection and tons of hard drive space for long trips so i can verify what i 've taken and that subnotebook also saves me from having to buy extra compactflash . 
##the compact flash is delicate and i hate to swap it in fear on the connetions ( camera and cf ) bending ( can lead to cf erros ) or losing it . 
##anyways , canon has improved upon the g2 with this g3 . 
##it 's a winner . 
picture quality[+2]##i 've been pleased with the picture quality and durability in snow , car , boat and wind . 
##my only suggestion is to get a lens protector to help protect the shooting lens ( the lens coating will wear out after so many clean wipes ) and i 'm getting the those ( 52 mm adapter and uv lens filter ) at lensmateonline.com . 
##they got the best lens adapter for the g3-better than canon 's . 
##that 's what i did and hopes this helps . 
[t]canon g3 review / response / recommendation 
camera[+2]##the camera 's a work of art / science -- that 's understood . 
picture[+2],feel[+1][u]##it takes great pictures , operates quickly , and feels solid . 
viewfinder[-2]##to address two previous somewhat negative reviews : ( 1 ) yes , the lens barrel does obstruct part of the lower left corner in the lens viewfinder ; however , the lcd viewfinder is rather stunning and i find myself rarely using the lens viewfinder . 
##( 2 ) there are , actually , several differences between the g2 and g3 , such as differences in continuous shooting , the optical lens , the control layout , playback zoom , image processing , and so on . 
[t]beware 
##you see , i can 't rank the product since the merchant that amazon is collaborating with ( j and r camera . ) to bring us consumers better choices never sent me the product . 
##although you may think you 're dealing with amazon , you 're dealing with some second rate store that you 've never heard of . 
##after charging my card for the camera and for expedited shipping , 5 business days later , they still had n't shipped the product . 
##i called them twice and both times they said it is " about to ship " . 
##one of the calls was on a saturday and when i pressed the guy a bit , he said , " actually we do n't ship on saturdays " . 
##so why lie about it ? 
##so i finally gave them a deadline which they said they could meet . 
##although they accepted that they will ship on mon - 6 jan , they still did n't ship it . 
##they said it is in stock , but they are " too busy " . 
##they were n't busy enough to charge the credit card , though ! 
##although i tried contacting amazon to see if they can do anything , the replies i got were inept as if they had n't taken time to read the complaint . 
##i cancelled the order . 
##hope to get my refund in a timely manner . 
##thanks for nothing , amazon ! 
[t]major design flaw 
design[-3]##this camera has a major design flaw . 
viewfinder[-2]##when you look through the viewfinder ( not the lcd ) the bottom left corner of the picture ( about 15 % ) is blocked by the lens . 
##i called the canon technical service center to see if i had a defective camera . 
##after about a minute of trying to tell me that most people use the lcd and not the view finder , they finally admitted , it was a design flaw in the camera . 
camera[+2]##everything else about the camera is great . 
camera[+2]##if you strictly use the lcd and not the view finder , i highly recommend the camera . 
##however for me , i occasionally use the view finder and trying to frame in a picture with the lens blocking the view is too much . 
##i 'm sending mine back and am waiting for the problem to be corrected . 
[t]i love it more the longer i own it 
##i 've been using a powershot s330 for nearly a year , and wanted to upgrade to a 4 or 5 megapixel camera with a longer zoom , more adjustability , a hot shoe for an external flash , and a remote control . 
##i looked at both the nikon coolpix 5700 and the canon g3 , and decided on the g3 due both to ergonomics ( much more comfortable to hold and use ) and the price . 
##i 've had the camera for about two weeks and shot hundreds of pictures so far . 
camera[+3][u]##and so far , i 've been very pleased . 
##there 's a noticeable difference in the quality of a 4 megapixel image versus the 2 megapixels of the s330 , especially if you want to crop and enlarge the pictures . 
lens[+2],optical zoom[+1]##the larger lens of the g3 gives better picture quality in low light , and the 4-times optical zooms gets you just that much closer . 
lcd[+2]##the moveable lcd screen is great . 
##you can take pictures with the camera held above your head , way down , or beside you with no problem , allowing you to position the camera for the best shot without contorting yourself . 
remote[+2]##the tiny ( postage-stamp sized ) remote unit is wonderful : not only does it trigger the shutter , it can also be used to zoom and review pictures . 
##i also purchased a good sturdy tripod : the combination of the new camera , tripod and remote control enabled me to take some remarkable indoor , natural-light portraits i never would have attempted before . 
hot shoe flash[+1]##the hot shoe flash attachment allowed me to buy and use a sophisticated flash unit : 
##i chose the canon speedlite 420 . 
##this has made the greatest difference in the quality of my photographs : the built-in flash on any of these cameras gives you flat photos , red-eye , and annoying shadows ; a good add-on flash unit can be bounced off the ceiling or wall for pleasing , almost-natural lighting . 
battery[+2]##i needed three batteries to keep myself going with the s330 , but the battery in the g3 is a real powerhouse : 
##i shot over 300 photos at my goddaughter 's birthday party without switching out to my backup battery . 
battery charging system[+1]##the g3 has a different type of battery charging system from the smaller canon cameras : the battery needs to be charged while in the camera , but the charging system also enables you to use the camera while plugged in without running down the battery . 
manual[+1]##i have yet to try using all of the adjustment options : shutter priority , aperature priority , light metering adjustments , etc. , but all controls are well thought out and and the manual is relatively clear . 
##you can use this camera right out of the box on the automatic setting , or slowly get comfortable with the manual settings and what they can do . 
##negatives ? 
highlight[-1]##i 've been bothered by blown-out highlights on the s330 , and the g3 seems to do only slightly better . 
##( i 'm starting to think that this may just be one of the weaknesses of all digital photography at this level . ) 
no-off button[-2]##the on-off button feels somewhat flimsy , and has an awkward , tiny little lock-out button that needs to be depressed to turn on the camera . 
body[-2]##and the body / construction in general has quite a bit of plastic , a disappointment after the stainless steel heft of the s330 . 
##i bought a 512 mb card , which seems to hold about 400 photos at the highest resolution . 
download[+1]##i was worried that 4 megapixel photos would download more slowly , but there 's no difference in working with the files . 
##i have a 120 gb remote drive i use to store my digital images : 
##i can imagine that they 'd fill up my ibook 's internal memory pretty quickly . 
##at the same time i purchased this camera i also bought adobe 's photoshop elments 2.0 software , and can 't praise it highly enough . 
##if you 're investing in a camera at this level , buy this software ! 
##and as i said in my review of the s330 , all of these digital cameras are easier to use with apple computers . 
##the bottom line : if you 're serious about your digital photography , or been bitten with the bug after using a digital point-and-shoot , this may be just the camera for you . 
##but make sure to buy a tripod and separate flash unit at the same time : you 'll see the difference in your photos immediately . 
##added 2-24 . 
camera[+3]##i 've now had the camera for two months and i 'm even more pleased with it . 
##i wound up buying a gray card and use it all the time with the custom white-balance setting . 
##it helps avoid the problem of a color cast on the pictures , especially in mixed-light settings . 
##if you do n't have a gray card , you can use a plain white piece of paper . 
##i also discovered the exposure-bracket setting , which enables you to take three exposures with one press of the shutter : the first at the camera-determined exposure , then one lighter and one darker . 
##especially useful with portraits and difficult-to-meter situations . 
##i did buy the telephoto lens ( and the required extension ) . 
##very easy to use . 
##i 'll probably also get the wide-angle now , too . 
camera[+3],use[+1],photo[+3]##very comfortable camera , easy to use , and the best digital photos you 're going to get at this price . 
[t]best non-slr digital camera under 5 megapixels 
g3[+2]##i 've been using the g3 for about six weeks and it has proven itself to be all that it 's advertised . 
##after doing a hands-on comparison between the nikon coolpix 5700 and sony dsc-f 717 ( both of which lack the quality , feel , or features of the g3 ) , i ultimately chose the g3 because of its outstanding image quality ( resolution and coloration are superior ) . 
##it beats the competition in almost every area including battery life , enthusiast features , external flash capabilities , available storage types , image formats , and more . 
##this is a camera you will need to study and use in order to fully exploit its many features . 
##it can be a point-and-shoot camera , but if you do not intend to " get into " it 's finer features , i 'd suggest a less enthusiast featured choice . 
camera[+3]##all-in-all , i believe this is arguably the best non-slr digital camera on the market . 
[t]the best so far 
##the canon g3 improves in almost all ways on the g1 and g2 before it , and in fact beats the nikon coolpix 5000 in performance ( picture quality and battery life ) -- which is amazing because the 5000 is a 5 megapixel camera and the canon is a 4 megapixel camera . 
optic[+2]##canon 's optics are better and i believe their processing algorithms are also better . 
digital camera[+3]##simply , the canon g3 is the best digital camera out there today at this price point . 
##the canon allows you to change lenses , and it accepts the ibm microdrive ( type ii compact flash ) , so you can have up to 1 gigabyte of storage . 
##for me on the fine resolution setting ( not maximum but very close ) this adds up to over 1000 images with the 1 gig card . 
battery life[+2]##the battery life of this camera is twice that of the nikon 5000 and is better than anything else i 've seen . 
look[-2]##the only minor nits i have with the camera are it is fairly boxy looking , it needs a wrist strap instead of a neck strap , and it is a bit slow between shots . 
camera[+3]##even with these shortcomings , i still think it is the best digital camera available under $ 1200 . 
[t]great camera but g2 will do the same for less 
camera[+3]##definetely a great camera . 
quality[+2],lens[+2]##proven canon built quality and lens . 
feel[+2]##feels solid in hand . 
weight[-1],camera[+2]##rather heavy for point and shoot but a great camera for semi pros . 
[t] a quick update to the new zen nx ? 
##this is an edited review , now that i have had time to use the device . 
affordability[+3]##while , there are flaws with the machine , the xtra gets five stars because of its affordability . 
bang-for-the-buck[+3][u]##it is the most bang-for-the-buck out there . 
size[+2],weight[+2],navigational system[+2], sound[+3]##like it 's predecessor , the quickly revised nx , this player boasts a decent size and weight , a relatively-intuitive navigational system that categorizes based on id3 tags , and excellent sound ( widely known to be better than ipod - not surprising considering the number of years creative has been in the audio peripheral business ) . 
screen[+3]##the xtra improves upon the zen nx with a larger , now-blue backlit screen , which is infinitely better . 
##further , the xtra doubles the maximum filecount capacity to 16000 mp3 . 
##this is especially useful for those who listen mostly to pop music and store all those short ditties . 
##when compared to the ipod the zen xtra falls short , but only by a bit . 
##yes the ipod is smaller , but not $ 200 worth , which is the premium you 'll pay for an equivalent capacity model . 
##yes , the ipod looks in tune with the carefully articulated urban-hipster persona thats become popular as of late , but sure-as-hell is n't worth the $ 200 premium ( unless you are just dying to match your music player with that volkswagen beetle and urban outfitters wardrobe ) . 
##for me , i 'll save that cash for another purchase . 
[t] get this player ! 
##before i decided to get this player , i did my research . 
##i looked up the ipod , the dell jukebox , and the samsung napster player . 
deal[+3]##i chose this one because from what i read , it was the best deal for the money . 
wma file[+2]##another reason i got it is because you can put wma files on it . 
##that takes up half the space of mp3 's . 
##that 's important because i have a lot of music . 
software[+2]##the software is great . 
##you can sort your music by artist , title , album , or genre , and you can play music based on those categories . 
software[+2]##transfering is easy , the software makes everythig pretty easy . 
battery life[+2]##even the battery life is great - it advertises 14 hours , it 's actually a little less but still good . 
accessory[-1]##only 1 problem , no accessories ... yet . 
remote[-2]##i hope it 's because it 's new and they are not out yet , but being without a remote is hard . 
interface[+2]##they player 's interface itself is also very easy to use . 
##can 't complain and i recommend it over all the other players , just hope that remote will come out soon . 
player[+3][p]##get it , it 's woth every penny ! ! 
[t] kick a player 
##i was a little concerned to be the black sheep buying this player instead of the incredibly overpriced apple i-pod . 
player[+3][p]##i 've had it for a week now , do n't regret the purchase one bit , and i never leave home without it . 
##if you have any doubts about this player , well do n't . 
##pros : 
software[+2]##software is easy to use ( although redhat software is better , but costs money ) 
price[+2]##much cheaper than i-pod good looking player ( beautiful blue back-lit screen ) if you 've read about the player , some have complained about the lack of a viewing hole for the face when the case is on , but this is good because the face does n't get damaged / scratched fast transfer rate 
##no issues as of yet 
##cons : 
headphone[-3]##you 're going to need to buy new headphones , the stock ones suck 
##hopefully , this player will out sell the ridculously over-hyped i-pod . 
##if you want to be a poser and follow the herd , mooooooh , then buy the i-pod . 
##otherwise , be smart , save the cash . 
[t] the sound is the thing ! 
##for me the sound of the music is what is important . 
sound[+2]##the zen xtra sounds great with good headphone and well recored mp3s . 
navigation[-1]##navigation is a bit tricky and takes getting used to but the included pdf instructions cover the operation pretty well . 
weight[+2]##at 8 ounces it is pretty light but not as light as the ipod . 
battery[+2],leather case[+2]##the battery is replaceable ( a real plus ) and there is a leather case ( another real plus ) . 
##i suppose that you could jog with it but it seems to be made for the enjoyment of music . 
software[+2]##so far the software for the pc works easily . 
looking[+2]##by the way , it looks nice also . 
[t] an ipod killer : 
##this thing kicks mighty apple butt ! 
##i would have given this thing 4.5 stars but since i can 't , i 'll be sweet and give it the full 5 stars . 
player[+3][p]##it 's worth it . 
##i personally do n't like apple or their business practices ( screwing resellers , customers and employees left and right ) so i shopped around for something else . 
##after finally stumbling upon this zen nx player , i knew i had found what i was looking for . 
battery life[+2],price[+2]##my two main requirements were longer battery life and lower price : i found both . 
##this thing lasted well over 14 hours when i played it straight for the first time . 
##the zen nx is $ 100 cheaper than the ipod of the same size , so you have to wonder just how much apple 's markup is anyway ! 
sound[+3], headphone[-2]##the sound is excellent , but a tip : get a real pair of headphones . 
##you wo n't appreciate the quality this thing has to offer unless you are using a good set of cans. 
control[+2]##the controls are on the side instead of on the front , which i like , because that 's where my thumb is when i hold the thing ! 
scroll wheel[+2]##the scroll wheel is a big improvement over the ipod touchpad . 
size[-1]##it could be a little bit bigger , but it 's easy to get used to . 
screen[-1]##the screen may be a little smaller , but it is very readable and does n't come in the overused blue . 
firewire[-1]##it does n't have firewire , not a real complaint since most windows users do n't generally have firewire cards themselves . 
##( i would have appreciated having a firewire plug , however ) 
leather pouch[+3]##the included leather pouch is a big plus : it actually protects the unit well , something a lot of ' carrying cases ' fail to do with other audio devices . 
battery[+2],construction[+2],size[+2],weight[+2]##other plusses : changable battery , loads of presets for environments , decent construction , still quite small and light despite being slightly bigger than an ipod . 
##( did i mention you can actually change the battery ? hello ? apple ? are you listening ? ) 
##i probably would have liked to have a player in something other than silver / metallic ... like the battery adapters on their usb thumbdrive ( muvo nx ) mp3 player models . 
##since the front plate is removable to access the battery compartment , aftermarket alternate covers would not be difficult or expensive to make . 
size[+1][u],sound[+2],price[+2]##overall : small , sounds great , and less expensive than apple 's overpriced ipod ! 
battery[+2]##( batteries last longer too ! ) 
[t] way better than a i-pod ! 
##i shopped around for a month looking for a good mp3 player , and all i heard was how good the i-pod was . 
##after messing with it at a store i noticed how bad the i-pod was . 
##it was marked up increadably high compared to other models ( almost $ 500 for a 30gb ) , and theres was nothing about it that made it worth that much money . 
player[+], price[+3]##the creative labs zen xtra has all the features the i-pod has and if you get if from amazon your only going to pay $ 300 for this great player . 
player[+3]##i 've had it for about 2 weeks and it 's the best player i 've seen , and used , ever . 
menu[+2]##the music is easy to get to ( all of the menus are easy to understand despite what alot of i-pod owners say ) and if you know how to search for an artist by name online , then you can do the same with the zen . 
screen[+2]##the screen is very easy to read and the blue light is bright enough to read at night , but dim enough so it does n't blind you when you stare too long . 
player[+3],use[+3], software[+2],sound[+3]##all in all this a great player that blows the i-pod away , with easy to use and understand features , software that is simple to understand and use , and a great sound ( which is all that matters in a mp3 player ) . 
##just get some new headphones and your set . 
[t] great product for a windows computer . 
##within 5 minutes i was able to transfer files . 
program[+3]##it 's a very intuitive program . 
installation[+2]##i had no problems following their installation instructions . 
menu[+3]##the menus are very easy to navigate . 
scroll wheel[-1]##the only complaint i have is that when you push in the scroll wheel to select , you have to push straight in or it sticks . 
control[+3]##the other controls are all very easy to use . 
play option[+1]##it has several play options , one of the best is an option to shuffle , based on all or a certain playlist . 
playlist[-1]##the only downside i see is that it does n't look like you can manage playlists from the nomad , it has to be done from the computer . 
##unlike the ipod , this is fully windows compatible and can be used right out of the box . 
##for ipod you have to buy a cable and it is n't compatible with all windows pcs. 
price[+2][u]##it also costs a lot less than the ipod . 
earbud[+1]##the earbuds that come with it are n't that bad . 
earbud[+2][p]##they 're pretty comfortable , stay in place and deliver a decent audio quality . 
deal[+2]##this is a good deal for music and data storage . 
[t] the interfacing software is unacceptably bad . 
##one thing i should note is that i have only had this product for one day , so there are many options i have not explored . 
software[-2]##the main problem with the nomad jukebox zen xtra 30 gb is the software . 
##on my relatively new computer ( p4 with windows xp and usb 2.0 ) , the os complained about the installation of the drivers . 
##despite the instructions insisting that the process was fairly automatic , i had to install the usb drivers and the nomad interface software manually . 
software[-2]##the interface software itself , which should be user-friendly , was anything but easy-to-use . 
##with the nomad explorer software , songs should be drag-and-drop . 
##i have not yet tried the cd-ripping program . 
player[-2]##the player itself has all sorts of problems . 
face plate[-1]##the face-plate , which pops out for the battery , pops open by itself every 10 minutes or so . 
file transfer[-1]##the player hangs up on file transfer every once-in-a-while , prompting a reset . 
scroll[-1]##the scroll button is overly sensitive at times ; not sensitive enough at others . 
scroll[-1]##depressing the scroll button ( for selecting ) is not always responsive . 
scroll[-1]##the scroll bar problems make the task of creating playlists more frustrating . 
sound[+2]##on the positive side , the sound of the player is pretty good , once you have everything configured . 
audio[+2]##i have n't had time to really push this player to the limit , but audio aspects on the nomad are satisfactory , as should be expected from creative labs . 
player[-3]##overall , a very disappointing product . 
setup[-3],interface[-3]##the setup process for the nomad is infuriating , and the interface with the player is sub-par . 
player[-2]##the player 's mechanics are also flawed . 
player[-2]##although the sound-quality is good , it takes more than good sound on a portable-mp 3 player to result in a good product . 
[t] great player . 
##i was trying to decide whether or not i should go with the 40 gb ipod or this 30 gb zen xtra . 
price[+2]##when it came down to it , the price on this player is hard to beat . 
##if you want the other accessories the ipod offer , maybe that 's where you should go .. . 
##this is a great investment for someone like me who enjoys music and hates carrying multiple cds . 
##i just transfered over some 40 cds and have plenty of space left for me . 
scroll[-1]##one beef is the scroll , it does n't work as well as i 'd like . 
this thing[+3]##other than that this thing is great ... 
##enjoy ! 
[t] replaceable battery lets zennx keep running and running . 
battery[+2]##zennx 's replaceable battery was the deciding factor in my purchase of zennx over ipod . 
##all rechargeable batteries lose their holding power over time ( around 2 years ) . 
##apple 's solution - pay apple another $ 400 + for a new ipod ( less a paltry discount ) . 
battery[+2]##the zennx will keep running for the price of a replacement battery , just like any other battery-powered appliance . 
earphone[-1],software[-1]##deficiencies with zennx are easily overcome with 3rd-party earphones ( $ 20 + ) and software ( $ 25 ). 
##notmad by red chair software is an explorer-based program that enables simple drag-and-drop transfer of music files from pc to zennx . 
screen[+2],switch[-2]##the blue-screen display in the zennx xtra model is an improvement , but the toggle switch is still tricky . 
##zennx 's capacity / price ratio on the 30g model ( $ 10/gig ) ) trumps ipod 's 30g model ( $ 14/gig ). 
##choosing zennx is a no-brainer when factoring in the cost of a new $ 400 + ipod every few years versus the $ 50 cost of replacing zennx 's rechargeable battery . 
##zennx hopefully will gain market share and prompt arrogant apple to lower prices and enable consumers to replace the battery . 
##update : apple recently announced that for $ 107 , it will replace the battery in ipods shipped to their factory . 
##lithium ion rechargeable batteries are good for 300-500 rechargings , so battery lifespan will vary according to your usage . 
##still , apple continues to squeeze dollars from consumers by not designing the battery to be replaceable . 
[t] terrific mp3 player , great price . 
nomad[+3]##i love my new nomad , its great ! 
##now i dont have to lug around 80 cds if i dont know what i 'm going to want to listen to biking home . 
look##this thing , while looking pretty cool , is not as sexy as the ipod . 
price[+3]##for some this might be a problem , but for the price of a 30 gig ipod , you can get a 60gb nomad , the ipod simply pales in comparison . 
software[+3]##the software is very easy to use , and within 30 minutes of opening my box , i was out and about listening to any one of my 80 cds . 
case[+2]##the free ( i didnt know they still did that ) carrying case is really protective , and to me its the only accessory you need ( except good headphones ) . 
headphone[-1], sound[+3]##on the subject of headphones , this thing seems like a normal mp3 player when you use the headphones they give you in the box , but invest 30 dollars in a nice pair and the sound quality goes up through the roof ! 
##if you want a sexy , cool , accessory-availible mp3 player , by all means , get an ipod for a hundred dollars more ( or one for the same price that holds 1/3 of the music ) . 
deal[+3], mp3 player[+3]##but if you want a great deal and a great mp3 player , get the nomad . 
player[+3][u]##best electronic i 've bought since i was born . 
##flat out 
[t] impressed ! 
##i just sold my archos 20gb jukebox recorder after not being satisfied with it 's slow loading & difficult navigation , not to mention it froze quite a bit . 
##i was in search of a new item to take it 's place as my new mp3 player / harddrive . 
##for an early christmas gift , i got a zen xtra 40 gb player . 
##i refused to go for an ipod , i am not going to spend all that money just for the apple name and because it is " trendy " to have that player . 
##this was the closest alternative and best buy for this type . 
##after receiving my zen xtra 40gb mp3 player .. . 
##i will just say this : 
##i will never go back to my archos again ! ! 
set up[+3]##so easy to set up , had some problems with my archos . 
##stayed up all night trying to figure out that thing . 
nomad explorer[+2]##just easily drag and drop files into the nomad explorer and from there you easily alter id tags and sort your music according to your liking , by artist , song title , genre , etc. 
player[+3][p],look[+2][u]##not only is it functional and runs super smooth & fast , but it is also eye candy . 
design[+3][u]##very sleek & stylish as well as the screen options and visuals it has . 
leather case[+2]##the leather case it comes with is pretty nice , similar to a pda style case and does hold and protect it perfectly . 
button[+2]##all the buttons & neccessary lil ' gadgets are on the sides of the player which is nice for when you are holding it in the palm of your hand . 
sound quality[+2]##the sound quality is also nice ... after i hooked up my sony headphones instead of those factory earbuds it comes with . 
sound option[+1]##lots of sound options , has an equalizer almost like winamp with the options . 
navigation[+3]##navigation is so smooth and finding files is a cinch . 
navigation[+2]##also navigating while playing music is a plus unlike my previous player . 
##it was impossible to do so before . 
screen saver[+2]##oh , and the screen saver feature is pretty sweet ^ _ ^ 
file limit[+2]##another plus in my book , no file limits ! 
##i was limited to 999 files in a playlist with archos ' os , now i can have as many as i want . 
playlist[+2]##i have over 2000 files in my playlist at the moment and the random does a nice job mixing it up . 
storage[+2][u]##i am quite happy having over 10 gigs of music stored on this baby as well as a few gigs of media files in the data folder . 
##now i can transport files to friends house with ease . 
##when plugged in , it does n't lag the computer like the archos did ... unless you are doing a massive transfer of data in one load . 
##after playing with this little device , i do n't know why i would look at an ipod with the same space when it costs $ 500 and i got mine for a little more than half that price ! 
player[+2][u]##i really have no complaints over this unit . 
player[+3]##i really do recommend this to anyone in need of a new player . 
##in fact , my boyfriend is now going to invest into one of these suckers as well ... now he realizes that this is the best choice over his current archos and the ipod he was eyeing . 
[t] not able to install . 
installation[-3]##getting the program to install properly has been a living hell experience . 
##the cd just has too many problems with win xp . 
##i am going to have to try an online download and see if that works . 
manual[-3]##also , the instruction manual is very bad . 
[t] fantastic piece of machinery . 
player[+2]##i have no complaints with this mp3 player . 
file transfer[+2][u]##getting files onto it is quick and painless . 
sorting[+2]##then sorting the files is easy as pie . 
storage[+3][u]##and it holds sooooo much music and audio files . 
player[+2][p]##my music demands are pretty intense and this handles those demands without problems . 
sound[+3],earphone[-3]##also , the sound is wonderful ... my only gripe were those aweful earphones that this came with . 
##come on, at $ 300 they could at least put in a good pair of earphones . 
##sheesh ! ! 
battery[+2]##the battery is nice . 
##i listened to it for several days before needing to recharge them . 
screen[+3]##the lcd screen was very large and readable . 
##thank you ! 
##my last mp3 player 's screen drove me nuts . 
##a great buy . 
player[+3]##compared to everything else in this category , this is most definately the best bang for the buck . 
[t] not ipod competition . 
##i think the whole zen line has been fairly innovative and reasonably priced , but it 's not really appropriate to compare the pricing of the zen line to the ipods ( although , the ipod is still way over priced ) . 
##you 're talking totally different hardware . 
##all of the zens use a standard notebook drive . 
##this puts the zen in line with players like the rca jukebox and the whole line of archos players ( the newer ones are a bit better than the original archos jukeboxes ... but i popped out the drive in my 20 gig jukebox recorder and put in a 60 gig drive and use it exclusively as a powered portable usb 2.0 drive ). 
##the ipod uses a smaller ( and more expensive ) drive ( 1.8 " ) . 
##the devices competing with the ipod are the iriver ihp 120 , the rio karma , and the philips hdd100 . 
##i should point out that the new rio karma is now down to about $ 280 and is reviewed readily as being as good as ( and better in some areas ) the ipod . 
##the 20 gig ipod still goes for just under $ 400 . 
##that 's a huge difference ... especially in this price range . 
##i can 't believe people continue to pay those prices . 
##advertising pays off i guess .. . 
##i doubt anyone has ever seen an add or commercial for any other mp3 player . 
zen[+3]##i gave the zen 5 stars because it 's excellent for the class that it is in and it 's not really appropriate to rate it based on players in a different class . 
##my personal favorite is the karma ( i currently own a karma , a zen usb 2.0 , a philips hdd100 , and an upgraded 60 gig archos jukebox recorder ). 
##i guess that 's why you so often see " ipodders " bashing every other player out there ( very often not knowing anything about them the whole " i spent $ 120 more for something not any better and so should you ... so i can feel better " thing . 
[t] ipod vs nomad zen xtra 
##i originally purchase a 30 gb nomad zen xtra as a portable mp3 player . 
##after fiddling around with it for a while , i notice a few dissapointments : 
transfer[-2]##transfering - i could not get my songs to completely transfer via usb 1.1 or 2.0 . 
transfer[-2]##it would only transfer 30 or so songs , and then come up with an error . 
##having 4000 or so mp3s , i never got more than 500 transfered . 
scroll wheel[-2]##scroll button - the scroll wheel was a nice idea to keep less clutter , but the button would sometimes get stuck or keep scrolling . 
size[-1]##size - bigger than the ipod 
software[-1]##software - music match jukebox is n't the greatest , the search funtion is n't fast even when accessing it with the hotkey shortcut . 
##after i went through the transer issue , i returned the zen xtra and purchased the 40 gig ipod . 
##song transfers were not an issue . 
##i transfered all 16 gigs in 15 minutes without any errors via firewire . 
##the navigion on it can be a little quirky , but still operates better than the zen 's did . 
##the ipod is also an attractable piece , being lightweight and small . 
##the casing scratches a little easy , but the glove cases work great to protect against this . 
sound quality[+1]##sound quality was the same between the two , but the zen did have more sound adjustments with the normal eax features . 
##i chose to keep the ipod and am very happy with the purchase . 
##granted it is a little more than the zen , it is well worth it . 
##itunes is a versatile program and i have n't had any issues with the ipod itself . 
[t] wonderful . 
player[+3]##i love this player . 
##its great . 
player[-1][p]##all i have to say is that i did freeze on me once , but it has n't done it since . 
player[+3]##i love this player and would probably go with creative labs again . 
software[+2]##the software was great , as long as you have an adminstrative user account ( windows xp ) . 
##i got every song i had downloaded to the player within a day or so . 
##it only took about 30 minutes to download everything , and that was about 950 songs . 
player[+3]##anyway , this player is a great deal and i really love it . 
[t] a good product . 
size[-2][u],weight[-2][u],look[-1],folder structure[-1]##first , the cons ... a tad bulky ... not the most asthetic looking player ... and does n't support a folder stucture . 
##the pro ... 
price[+2][u]##way less expensive than the ipod . 
##my opinions : 
##personally , i do n't understand all the complaints about the interface .. . 
interface[+2]##i find it pretty easy to use ... and unlike the remote interface for the audigy 2 nx ( on the pc ) .. . 
##it actually gives the option to clear the previous playlist when i want to play another list . 
##meaning i do n't have to manually clear the list , and then load the new list . 
folder structure[-2]##the cons are n't really a big deal to me ... except one con that does annoy me is the way it stores files ... no folder structure ... and it 's based on the title of the songs ... many of my songs where seperated into folders ( on the pc ) ... and a few had same titles ... so i had to change the titles to make sure that i did n't have any that might be the same as another . 
chinese name[-2]##and man ... i had to work to put my chinese songs on the player ... because i had the actual chinese names of the songs as the title .. 
##and since the current language selection was english ( even though i think only the menu supports chinese , and not the track info ) ... all it saw were " ? " s and even though the songs had different names in chinese .. 
##if it had the same number of " ? " s then it would ask if you want to overwrite another song that just had the same number of " ? " s. . . 
##buyer beware ! sort your songs and adjust the titles accordingly ( maybe this applies to other players too , and not just the nomad , i do n't know ) . 
##i would 've still bought this drive even if i knew about this issue beforehand . 
transfer[+2]##not counting the time i spent editing the songs ( i suppose i should 've done it anyway on my pc ) the transfer was pretty painless . 
##once you start sending files , it 'll continue until it 's done or it hits a song that has the same title as another song ... at which point you can skip , skip all , replace , replace all , or cancel . 
##and go from there ... if you chose one of the " all " options , then you do n't need to do anything until it 's done . 
##in two transfer batches ( first was english songs , then foreign languages ) , it did n't come up with any errors ( aside the duplicate name i mentioned ). 
##so i do n't know what the previous review that could n't do more than 30 songs is talking about . 
##of course , unlike that person i will mention that i upgraded the firmware to 1.23 . 00. but i did transfer files before the upgrade without problem too . 
##you should update the firmware before upgrading the drivers if you decide you need the newer drivers for the pc. 
##the mediasource itself was flaky ... crashing my explorer twice within the first hour ( the crash did n't require a reboot ) ... but after another reboot , it has n't crashed since . 
##did i mention i 've already dropped it once ? 
##that was n't pretty . 
##there 's a dent on the upper-back-right and lower-back-right corners ... not too obvious unless you 're up close . 
##hehe , my bad . 
##that 's all for now . 
[t] so far , it 's sweet . 
xtra[+3][u]##bought the 30gb xtra a couple of weeks ago , and so far it has been excellent . 
storage[+2][u]##i still have over 19gb left , and already have over 200 cd 's on it . 
##i 'll have to borrow cd 's to rip from friends to even come close to filling the thing . 
##i 'm not sure why people have problems with either the interface of the nomad , or the software that comes with the unit . 
interface[+3][p],software[+3][p]##both are very easy to learn & use , and intuitive enough for even a novice . 
##besides user error ( surprise , surprise ) , it 's hard to imagine people having trouble with either . 
transfer[+2]##ripping & transferring tunes is basic , and pretty fast ( even on a 1.1 usb ) . 
case[+2]##people also have complained about the case not having a window , but that 's not really a big deal to me either -- the case is sturdy and offers very good protection . 
case[+2][p]##it 's easy enough to pop it open to see what song you 're listening to . 
sound quality[+2],look[+3],screen[+2], battery[+3]##the sound quality is excellent ( and i 'm fussy with that stuff ) , the unit looks cool , screen is bright and easy to read , and the replaceable battery means a major advantage over the ipod ( besides the price , but everyone knows that ) . 
option[+2]##you of course have some good customization options with the unit as well ( sound presets , navigating options , playlists , etc ) . 
##i just put it on " shuffle " , sit back , and enjoy the eclectic mix that almost 3,000 tunes offer ! 
button[-1]##the only thing i 'm concerned about is the quality / longevity of the buttons on the thing . 
button[-1]##my " fast forward " button works , but it takes a little extra pressure on it to make it go . 
##not an urgent issue , as it still works .. . 
button[+1]##all other buttons are pretty sensitive to touch and work well . 
##i 'll have to see if this becomes a problem down the road . 
support[+2]##but i 've already emailed creative tech support about it , and gotten timely responses - they will fix it for me if necessary .. . 
##we 'll see if i need them to . 
size[-1]##sure , it 's a little bigger than the ipod , but not by much . 
##this is not the unit you should use if you go jogging anyway . 
size[+1][u],weight[+1]##it still fits in the palm of your hand , and it 's not heavy . 
##i use mine at the office , in the car ( with a cassette adapter ) , and will be taking it on a flight back east for the holiday . 
##yes . 
##get better headphones . 
##rip your tunes at 192kb if you like , alhthough 128kb sounds just dandy , and you 'll get more tunes stored on it . 
product[+2][u],price[+3]##bottom line ... great product , unbeatable price . 
##i got mine for $ 160 less than the ipod 30gb ( got an extra $ 30 off for applying for an amazon visa ... thanks amazon ! ) 
##basic shipping was a bit slow , but that 's okay . 
##i got it now , and i 'm diggin ' it . 
[t] nightmare . 
##awful , awful , awful . 
id3 tag[-3]##unlike my 3 other mp3 players , this thing will only work properly if you have id3 tags on all of your tracks . 
id3 tag[-3]##if you do n't have tags , it 'll lump all of your tracks into the same directory and they cannot be searched via artist or album as the zen does not recognize folders . 
##it 's a shame , but mine is going back . 
##bummer as it has great sound quality . 
[t] excellent product . 
player[+3][u]##i just received my 40gb zen xtra yesterday and i 'm extremely pleased with it . 
##my brother bought an ipod this past summer and my dad bought the original zen around the same time .. 
##just before we all spent a couple weeks in an rv together . 
##the ipod is a neat piece of machinery but after screwing around with both of them i think the zen products are the way to go . 
##so i requested and received a zen xtra as a christmas gift . 
setup[2], transfer[+2]##the setup and transfer process was cake for me . 
##i just used the explorer program to move my songs to my player . 
transfer[-1][u]##i did have to put a little work into renaming some duplicate file names to get all my music on my zen xtra but it was n't a big problem . 
explorer[-1]##the explorer program did shut down a couple times while i was renaming titles and changing genres but i did n't have to reboot the computer or anything , just open up explorer again . 
##it 's been so long since i 've had a program not shut down on me in windows that i hardly even noticed that it happened . 
##that 's probably a bad thing . 
player[-1]##the unit itself did lock up a few times and i had to hit the reset button but that was a fairly painless process as well . 
##it was always after it finished a process or something , so it did n't cause any file errors . 
player[+1]##now that i have all my music on it there has n't been any more problems . 
screen[+2]##the screen is large and bright and has all the info i need where i need it . 
##i have n't tried setting up any playlists yet so i can 't comment on any problems there . 
eax mode[+2]##the eax mode that keeps the volume at the same level for any song will come in handy when i take my holiday plane rides . 
jog dial[-2]##the little jog dial seems weak and quirky and i hope i do n't figure out a way to break it . 
##the dial on the original zen was perfect and i wish it was on this model . 
mp3 player[+3]##all in all though i 'm very happy with my new mp3 player . 
##i 'll admit that i 'd own an ipod if i had money to burn , but for the money this is a much better buy . 
##highly recommended ! 
[t] fantasic product . 
nomad[+3]##i purchased the nomad jukebox zen xtra 40gb and it is fantastic ! 
installation[-1]##i have windows xp pro and when installing the enclosed software i did receive a message that there was a problem installing the driver . 
##this was quickly and easily fixed by going to the creative web site and downloaded then installed the updated driver . 
software[+3]##i found using the supplied mediasource software very easy . 
##if you have always on internet or are logged into the internet you can use the feature that will download the album & song id information ( this is a free service ) with the click of a button . 
playlist[+2]##ripping your songs and creating playlists could n't be any easier . 
mediasource[+2]##i found using mediasource to load your songs to the nomad jukebox to be much easier and faster than using windows explorer . 
##just highlight the songs you want to transfer from your playlist or music library then click one button and it 's done ! 
playback quality[+3]##being a creative product the playback quality is unbeatable . 
##i use my own mid-priced headphones rather than the enclosed earbuds . 
sound[+3][u]##when i played back a symphony orchestra you would swear that you were seated dead center in front of the orchestra - it 's that good ! 
sound quality[+3]##the sound quality with jazz and pop music is equally superior . 
nomad[+2]##actually using the nomad jukebox is easy and uncomplicated . 
finding[+2]##finding a particular song ( s ) or album on the nomad jukebox is fast and easy . 
##i like to play my music by album and the nomad jukebox plays the songs in the same order as the actual cd . 
screen[+2]##the high resolution screen is easy to read and has a backlight . 
use[+3], playback quality[+3],price[+2]##i can highly recommend this product because of its ease of use ( hardware and software ) , playback quality and value for the price . 
[t] good value . 
player[+2][p]##just bought one & i 've enjoyed it to date . 
size[+1]##nice palm sized unit , somewhat bigger then the ipod but not an issue if you 're not going to try & jog with it or something . 
sound quality[+2]##all reviews i 've seen seem to indicate that the creative mp3 jukeboxes have the best sound quality of these 2nd generation jukeboxed ( ipod , archos , dell , samsung ) . 
eax[+1]##the eax settings are somewhat superfluous but not really a negative . 
player[-1]##i 've tried the belkin fm transmitter unit with it & it worked well when i set it on top of a portable radio , but was awful trying to use in the car which is somewhat of a disappointment . 
##dislikes 
control[-2]##- the controls are much inferior to the simple ipod ones . 
fly wheel[-3]##the black fly wheel feels pretty cheap & is uncomfortable to use . 
button[-2]##the locations of various buttons on one side or the other is somewhat illogical 
software[-2]##- included creative software is pretty poor . 
##red chair 's notmad explorer is great & recommended by about every reviewer to repleace the creative jukebox software . 
##note : this will add about $ 30 to the price to purchase , but worth it 
##likes 
price[+2]##- great value 40gb vs 10 gb ipod for the price 
sound[+3]##- best in class sound 
screen[+2]##- large easy readable screen 
[t] depressingly poor quality . 
##after receiving the box from amazon , i proceeded with charging the unit for the specified 4 hours , after which i installed the software and connected the unit to my pc via usb 2.0 . 
##the pc quickly picked up on it and attempted to install the software , which failed , as creative chose not to follow microsoft standards , whatever . 
##i then installed the software manually instead , after having to click past about 5 windows of " please register with us so we can spam your inbox " . 
##at this time , i decided to turn the player on , and much to my surprise it comes with quite the little library of classical music , one of which is a childhood favorite , bach 's air . 
play[-3]##i tried to play the song three times , with no success . 
play[-3]##it would either not play the song at all , or skip wildly , no matter that the unit was resting on my desk . 
##well , maybe that particular song was just corrupt , so i tried to upload some of my own , after four attempts , at each one the unit locked up and required a reboot , i managed to upload an album , which albeit was surprisingly fast , however when attempting to create a playlist out of my newly uploaded songs , the nomad again froze up and refused to work . 
##i made an additional five attempts at creating a playlist , before packing the unit up and heading over to amazon 's product return page . 
##needless to say , i would n't recommend anyone purchasing this product . 
software[-3]##had there been strange noises , or obvious defects , i would have accepted a replacement , but this is clearly from a defective and inferior operating system and i for one do not intend on waiting for patches . 
[t] wonderful . 
##charged my battery . 
##plugged it in . 
##installed software . 
##started ripping and transferring . 
##if you arent hooked up to cddb to get the album info i guess you have to manually input the stuff , but that little work will save you looking for songs . 
##i 've got 1200 songs on it now and about 4000 more to go . 
player[+2][p]##working for 10 hours with it on " shuffle " totally rocks ! ! 
player[+3][p]##i love it ! ! 
[t] poor reliability . 
##i bought this only to have it break within a month . 
player[-2][p]##this product is too fragile for normal use . 
[t] good player , but this technology is not yet great . 
##i received this as a gift . 
software[+1]##i had no problems setting up the software and getting my favorite cd 's transferred . 
software[-1]##however , the creative software is not real intuitive . 
software[-2]##the software is somewhat nice to look at , using it is not the easiest . 
rename[-2]##if you want to rename a cd title that you have already transferred , you will become frustrated quite quickly . 
##you are better off deleting it , re-ripping it with the new title and then transferring it to the player . 
transfer[+3]##transfers are surprisingly quick through usb 2.0 . 
sound[+2]##it is great sounding , even with the supplied earbuds . 
earbud[+2]##i must have differing preferences than others here , as i prefer the supplied earbuds to the sony 's that i thought sounded good on other players . 
storage[+3]##i love the storage in this thing . 
##i have 100 of my cd 's transferred and have n't made a dent in the 30 gb drive . 
##i doubt i will use half of the storage capacity , but you never know . 
##this is definitely opening up possibilities to obtaining mp3 's in which i would have never purchased the cd . 
##now my dissapointments . 
##the description of the warranty is buried on the supplied set up cd . 
##the warranty is 90 days . 
warranty[-3][p]##this is ridiculous . 
##to me this alludes to the manufacturer 's confidence that the product will last for a year . 
##buy the re-seller 's extended warranty and save yourself a headache for the problems you will have later , after all it is a hard drive and it will die or have issues over time ( probably sooner than later ) . 
scroll wheel[-3]##the scroll wheel , to be blunt , sucks . 
scroll wheel[-3][p]##seems it is always difficult to press to make a selection . 
interface[-2]##the interface used could be better designed . 
interface[-2][p]##it is a little cumbersome to scroll through so many levels to get to the selection you want . 
##i am a software engineer and if i wrote an interface to my software that worked like this , there would be hell to pay , not to mention the ridicule from my peers . 
case[-3]##and the case , how did this ever make it out of quality control . 
case[-3][p]##it is some protection for the unit , but for useability , forget it . 
##the screen is covered , so to make any new selections you have to open it . 
control[-2]##the cut-outs for the controls is not thought out as there is too much material in the way to adequately access the controls , especially the scroll wheel . 
##there are no other aftermarket cases available for this model yet , so you have to live with it . 
player[+2][p]##despite the things that i have listed so far , i could live with this item since it saves me from lugging a cd case to work , to the gym , in the car , etc. . 
lock up[-2]##however the main reason i am not satisfied with this product is the fact that it will lock up at odd times . 
##i have had it lock up after a transfer of music . 
##the files are there , but i could not access the player without removing the battery , waiting a short period and re-inserting the battery . 
##also have had it lock up when i shut it down to attend to a phone call . 
##left it set on my desk came back five minutes later and it just wanted to keep playing the same song over and over . 
##could not stop it , could not get out of the " now playing " screen . 
##again had to remove the battery . 
##there have been other occurrences of locking , but i will not bore you with the details . 
firmware[-2]##quite simply , the firmware and / or the os that control this thing is not ready for prime time . 
##there have also been times that the unit has been turned off for some period of time , upon powering it up it starts on the " now playing " screen with a song or cd that i had been playing days before . 
##i have n't quite figured this one out yet , but it is probably operator error . 
##now i have not owned other mp3 players as i was waiting until they matured , but since i received it as a gift i now have this one . 
##i would suspect that there are similar problems with all of the other brands as this is somewhat new technology . 
##and we all know about the rush to market on new products . 
##i have had this player for 2 weeks , i will be returning it for an exchange in the hopes that the locking problem and scroll wheel are problems with this particular unit . 
##while i am at the store i will definitely get the extended warranty as i have another day or so ( from the purchase date ) to obtain one . 
warranty[-3]##i know this unit will have problems in the future and the $ 40 for the 2 year " no questions asked " replacement warranty will be worth it , since creative will only warrant it for 90 days - which in itself is totally ridiculous ! 
[t] excellent product . 
player[+3]##this is my second creative labs mp3 player , and it is definitely a fine product . 
##first let me give you the bad things : 
size[-1],weight[-1]##1 . the size is a little bit bigger than the ipod , and it weighs a little bit more . 
scroll[-2]##2 . the scroll button is n't the best , as it sometimes can be hard to select . 
##3 . that 's pretty much all the negatives the positive things truly outnumber the negatives , and the negatives are n't that bad . 
sound quality[+3]##first of all the player 's sound quality is superior to the ipod . 
software[+3]##the player 's software is very easy to use and very good . 
software[+2]##compared to musicmatch , the software has a better filing system and easier to use . 
player[+2][p]##to keep it short , this is cheaper , and in my opinion a better choice than an ipod . 
[t] difficulties with tags . 
##if you purchase this product , definitely rip your songs through windows media player . 
##otherwise , you 'll have to mess around a lot with filenames inside the ( decent ) nomad explorer , which is not fun at all . 
player[+3]##this thing seriously is a good player though . 
[t] another electronics fan . 
##summary 
unit[+2]##overall i like the unit . 
player[-2][p]##i gave it only 3 stars due to the fact that the 1st one broke when i dropped it from a fairly short distance ( less than 2 ft ) . 
##if it were not for that i would have given it 4 . 
##pros : 
price[+2]##1 ) price / gb of storage 
storage[+2]##2 ) storage capacity 
battery[+2]##3 ) user replaceable battery 
##cons : 
construction[-2][u]##1 ) fragile ( i broke the 1st one within 10 days ) 
scroll[-2]##2 ) scroll button / switch 
case[-2]##3 ) the case hides the display - you have to open it to see what you are doing . 
##features that would have been nice : 
##1 ) fm receiver - some models out there have this . 
##2 ) fm transmitter - so you can place the unit in your car and listen to the unit through your car stereo . 
##they sell an adapter unit to use with your car 's cassette deck . 
##but who wants the wires involved . 
##a short range fm transmitter would be much nicer . 
##i believe the napster mp3 player has this feature . 
##details : 
##do n't drop this unit : 
##i 've had the player for about a month now . 
player[+2][p]##overall i like it . 
##as mentioned above i broke the player within the 1st 10 days . 
##i was sitting on a train and it fell off my lap and broke . 
##i think it fell right on the earphone plug when it fell ( murphy strikes again ) . 
##i was able to return it to the retailer where i bought it and got a replacement . 
##if you are going to need a player that is rugged this may not be the one for you . 
##i purchased the extended warranty ( something i almost never do ) when i returned the unit to get the replacement . 
##updating the unit 's firmware : 
##when i first purchased the unit i downloaded the firmware update that was available on their website . 
##the upgrade went smoothly and was easy to do if you can follow directions . 
##i would recommend doing the upgrade to be sure you have the best chance at trouble free operation . 
##storage : 
storage[+2]##the storage capacity is great . 
##i do n't think i will ever use the full 30gb . 
##i currently have ~ 1100 songs encoded mostly at 196 kpbs and i have n't even used 10gb of storage yet . 
##i 'm starting to listen to cd 's that i have n't listened to in years now that i have them all handy in one place . 
##for those out there that are not familiar with mp3 encoding , you can encode your cd 's at varying quality levels . 
##typically people use 96kbs to 320 kps. 
##the higher the number the better the quality ( less data compression is used ) and the larger the file size . 
##if you decide to encode at 320 you will fit less on this device than someone who encodes at 128kps . 
##you should consider this when deciding what bit rate you want to use and how much you want to put on the player . 
##if you 're someone who wants to put 10,000 songs on this thing you may want to encode at the lower end ( typically 128 is considered close to cd quality ). 
##price : 
price[+2]##the price compared to the ipod is great . 
price[+2],battery[+2]##price , along with the replaceable battery ( which i understand apple charges a small fortune to replace - as well as the hassle of returning it ) were the two main factors on why i picked the nomad . 
##one word of caution with regards to using the nomad with itunes . 
##i discovered this weekend that itunes does not sell mp3 's in the mp3 format . 
##it using something called ac3 ( at least the trial song i purchased was in this format ) which is not a compatible format for the nomad . 
##i have n't figured out if this is the case for all the songs on itunes . 
itunes[-2]##but for now it appears that this player does n't play well with itunes . 
##scroll bar : 
scroll[-2]##the scroll bar is a bit of a pain . 
##sometimes you skip past things or have to press it twice to select items . 
##it 's not the end of the world , but a better design sure would be nice . 
##software : 
software[+2]##i 've had no problems with the software . 
software[+2][p]##i found it intuitive to use ( i did n't read any documentation for it and was using it successfully within a few minutes ) . 
##the software will convert your cd 's to mp3 and put them on the player as well as your hard disk if you want it to . 
##my 2.6 mhz pentium 4 with usb 2.0 was able to perform the task pretty quickly ( i would estimate ~ 5 - 8 minutes per cd ). 
##through the software you can classify songs in genres . 
software[+2][p]##this is a nice feature ( i.e. it 's early in the morning and you rather listen to " easy listening " rather than " heavy metal " - no problem . 
software[+2]##the software comes with plenty of defaults genres . 
##you can also create your own if you do n't like their classifications . 
##you can edit the genres once the songs are on the play if you decide to re-classify things later . 
##this can be done on a song by song basis or in mass . 
##in addition , you can create play lists where you can create the equivalent to a compilation cd right on your player . 
##this is pretty cool . 
##sound : 
sound[+1]##the sound from the player is ok . 
sound[-1]##i was a little disappointed in the low end . 
##i did buy separate headphones as other have recommended . 
##i was able to improve things a bit by using the units equalizer and boosting the base . 
sound[-2]##the sound level is also not as high as i would have expected . 
##it 's probably good for the health of your ears , however i consistently play it near the high end of the volume range ( and my hearing is fine ). 
[t] searching for dennis ! 
##wow , dennis sure is great ! 
##slowly yet surely my unit engorged as i read my own review , similar to when i look in the mirror . 
this thing[+3]##this thing is great , i like to use it to pick up tough stains on my countertop and also to listen to my old 8-track records . 
##sometimes when i get really lonely , i like to put on some kenny g and light some candles , and while this does n't help , i am a capitalist pig and like buying things too , nah mean ! ? 
##i did have some problems figuring out how to turn the unit on , but creative did a good job with this , as they had a clearly labled " on " button that i found when i left my cellar for the first time in years . 
##there was very little light in there . 
##anyway , im gon na go find dennis now , have a nice day ! ! ! 
[t] it is ok , but .. . 
##i got my zen xtra a little bit more then a week ago . 
##it was not my first choice . 
##i have done a lot of research before i decided to buy the nomad zen xtra . 
storage[+2]##one good thing , it is 40 gb of disk space ( well , it is 38 gb in reality ) . 
price[+3],feature[+3]##for the price and features it is really good . 
##one thing , before buying this player i have called the creative tech. support and asked them if i can navigate by folders beside artist / album and answer was yes . 
##sure enough there is no such ability . 
##not sure , if customer rep. did not know the product exactly , it is still new or they just give an anser which users would like to hear . 
navigation[-2]##in any case , navigation by artist / album is ok however i miss an ability to navigate by folders . 
navigation[-2]##you even can not navigate by genre / artist / album since under genre you get just all tracks in that genre , no other division . 
##creative is talking about updating it via firmware , however after following some while the descussion groups for nomad players , looks like creative represents mostly bug fixes in their firmware updates , not too much of new features . 
software[-2]##the software , which comes with player is not good at all . 
nomad explorer[-2]##i did not managed to make creative nomad explorer to work . 
##after installing it and trying to make it working for 30 minutes i went and bought notmad . 
##notmad worked right away after install and it is what i would like to see from the product . 
##transfer files is easy using notmad , however again , would be great if nomad supported folders like iriver , rca lyra and some other . 
##often i fill i need to have better organization for the library and there is not enought of variables . 
##artist , album and genre are only mp3 tags which are supported buy this player , and if you have 100 artists would be good to have another subcategory . 
##after all those players have 40-60 gb of hard drive , so better organization is required . 
##the bottom line , i 'll still watch the progress of iriver hdd players and if they produce 40 gb player i 'll will sell my nomad and buy iriver . 
[t] the bundled software blows , yes ... ... but i heard of notmad explorer ( http://redchairsoftware.com) from the creative tech support people . 
##i downloaded the trial version , and after less than 10 minutes of using it , decided it was well worth the price . 
software[-3]##so yes , as with all software bundled with creative products , it was useless and ugly . 
##for once , though , this 3rd party software is excellent . 
##dont let the bad reviews of the software change your mind . 
##zens rule . 
[t] unmatched quality and beyond cool . 
##originally i wanted the ipod . 
##most people probably wanted the ipod before realizing that a vast array of full-featured viable alternatives exist . 
##i like the way apple is innovative , but let 's face it - they can 't be the only one with an idea to enclose a 2.5 " hd within an aluminum case in a stylish package for long , especially after the buzz is out of their little techie pod . 
zen[+3]##the 30gb zen xtra rocks my socks , spills my beer , but does n't wash my car . 
##so what ? 
##i can do that myself . 
battery life[+2],online music service[+2],pc compatibility[+2]##longer battery life , greater accessibility to online music services , and pc compatibility are the sensibilities . 
##the visceral teases include the case , the sound quality , and the capacity . 
##i have n't checked the resilience of my xtra yet , and do n't plan to . 
##however , if anyone has participated in violent or extreme sports while using their zen , please share your experiences . 
##i 'm considering using mine as a distraction to winter boredom in the paintball fields . 
##it can get pretty lonely out there . 
[t] creative thinking . 
player[+3]##i just purchased this player and i have to say that i love it . 
sound[+2],battery life[+2],price[+2][u]##the sound is excellent , the battery life is excellent , the fact that the battery is replacable is excellent , and finally the price , $ 200 cheaper than the 40gb ipod , is excellent . 
##the only thing the ipod has over the nomad is the style , size , and ease of use . 
style[+1],size[+1][u],control[+1]##the nomad is not ugly , it is not that big , it comfortably fits in my pocket , or heavy , and the controls are not hard to get used to . 
player[+2][p]##so far i have no complaints and i recommend this to anyone who wants quality over appearance , also anyone who wants a harddrive based mp3 player and wants to pay next to nothing . 
##i only have one question , when i add tracks to my nomad , via nomad explorer , they are automatically put in alphebetical order , rather than album order . 
##is this possible to fix , if so how , if not does notmad explorer from red chair software do this ? 
##i would like album order for my live albums and was just wondering . 
##thank you very much , and go out and get yourself a nomad ! 
[t] got to get an ipod ! 
##wow .. . 
player[-3][p]##this thing is trash . 
##want the laundry list of reasons why ? 
##of course you do ! 
construction[-3][u]##a ) feel cheap -- the plastic is feels like it would break very easily , and it definately wouldnt survive a drop 
screen[-3]##b ) the screen is hard to read -- the cover hides it an already annoying poorly lit display 
scroll[-2]##c ) the scroll bar is a travesty -- enough said 
software[-3]##d ) software is another great misfortune -- hard to operate , crashes frequently , screwed my music library up , doesnt work with mp4s , the list goes on and on 
case[-2]##e ) the case is too small -- it took me like a half hour just to get this monstrosity to fit in its cage 
look[-2]##f ) it doesnt look pretty -- spending this kind of cash , you want something that has the asthetics bit down , of course 
##so .. . 
##im taking mine back tomorrow morning , and getting a nice shiny new ipod instead . 
##do n't waste your time , engery , resources on this thing , just spend a little more for a far more functional ipod . 
[t] do n't buy it . 
##i bought the zen xtra 30g as a gift . 
##what a disappointment . 
software[-3]##the software failed repeatedly . 
##i could n't load more than one song before the software crashed . 
customer support website[-3]##creative labs customer support website is useless . 
software[-2]##software downloads on the site crashed my pc . 
##creative tech support operators work 9-6 p.m. weekdays - as if i had time during work hours to spend time on this . 
##do n't buy this thing . 
[t] great mp3 player . 
player[+3]##i just bought this player today and i already love it . 
play[-1]##it has a few inconveniences : one is that the songs do not automatically play one after another like on a cd . 
scroll[-2]##another irriation is that if you hold the scroll button down for too long , it keeps going past the song you may have wanted to stop on . 
player[+3]##otherwise , this player is awesome ! 
screen[+2]##it has a clear blue light that allows you to see everything on the screen easily . 
volume range[+2]##the volume range is great , so you can blast it if you want . 
player[+3]##overall , this player is awesome and i definately recommend it . 
[t] perfect purchase . 
this item[+3][p]##i received this item for christmas and it has met and exceeded all my standards . 
price[+2]##naturally i did quite a bit of review before purchasing ( i recomend www.nomadness.net ) , and price-wise zens are unbeatable . 
value[+3]##compared to other leading hdd mp3 players , the value per gb is the tops . 
##- price : see above . 
sound quality[+2]##- sound quality : excellent , everything you would expect from this company . 
use[+1][u]##- the unit is easy to use and intuitive . 
##it took me about 5 minutes before i had mastered the controls . 
uploading[+2]##- uploading music is quick and easy . 
software[+2]##although the supplied software can be annoying at times , on whole it is excellent . 
##i have uploaded about 3,000 songs now with very minimal difficulty . ( it 's fast too ! ) 
##btw , be sure to have your mp3 tags labled correctly , as this will ensure a great organization . 
player[+2][p],button[+2]##- the unit itself its well structured , with just the buttons you need and none you do n't . 
scroll[+1]##as often mentioned , the scroll tab is average , however , not difficult to use or horrible . 
##structurally , everything is secure and it wo n't fall apart on you . 
screen[+2]##the screen is large , defined , and easy to read , and the silver unit is naturally cool . 
feature[+1]##there are lots of interesting features included such as eax , and customization . 
battery[+2]##- the replacable battery is great since once it eventually wears out ( as all lithium batteries do ) , you will be able to buy another easily . 
##ipod users have to send theirs back and pay $ 100 for a replacement . 
battery life[+2]##also , the nomad 's 14 hours of battery life versus 8 is handy . 
equipment[+1]##- equipment included is average , but that is n't a big deal since thats not what you are buying it for . 
case[-1]##the case is strong and stylish , but unfortunately lacks a window ( now a big deal ) . 
headphone[+1]##the headphone earbuds are average , so just use your regular pair instead . 
##conclusion : 
player[+3]##this player is an ideal purchase . 
##there is n't need to get in details again , but just remember it rocks because : price , sound , ease of use , and features . 
##i would recogmend this player to anyone i know , and you will not be dissapointed . 
[t] impressive with few flaws . 
player[+3],software[-2]##the nomad jukebox zen xtra is a very good mp3 player but the software is it gets hurt . 
player[+3]##i have no problem using the player itself and i feel it is a very good player . 
software[-2]##on my main computer the software did not work right . 
customer support[-2]##i had to sit on the phone with customer support for 2 hours and they did not help at all . 
##i eventually gave up with customer support and worked on fixing the problem myself . 
player[+3]##i have the software working fine now and the mp3 player is fantastic . 
##it seems that depending on the system the software might not work or might work , because it works on all the other computers i have . 
player[+2]##so once i worked out the problem with the software this mp3 player is worth the money it cost . 
[t] awesome . 
zx[+3][p]##i 'm very pleased with my zx so here 's a quick review . 
##first there 's the unit itself . 
size[+1][u]##it is small overall , bigger than the ipod , but keep in mind that this is because different , less expensive but not necessarily inferior technology is used in the zx . 
sound quality[+3]##the zx boasts superior sound quality than the ipod , however it compromises a bit of the unit 's size in doing so . 
lcd[+2]##the lcd is larger than the previous model , the nx , and has a bright blue backlight which illuminates the screen more successfully than the nx 's green backlight did . 
scroll wheel[+2]##the scroll wheel is easy to use and works great for me , however many have complained that the wheel is cumbersome and difficult to operate . 
sound[+2]##the sound is excellent as one would suspect from a creative product . 
eax[+2]##the included eax support is useful at times , especially when you listen to a variety of genres , as it will adjust the equalizer for you which can be a big hassle . 
enviromental audio[-3]##the environmental audio , however , is almost completely useless and has made most of my songs sound worse than without it ( i encode my songs at 192-256 kbps without variable bit rates . ) 
signal to noise ratio[+2]##the signal to noise ratio ( the ratio of detectable , useful data to unusable garbage in , say , a radio wave ; a larger stn ratio is better ) is nice and high at 98 decibles , and it should be noted that apple refuses to release the stn ratio of any of the ipods . 
software[+2]##the software has n't been a hassle for me at all . 
##i ignored the instruction booklet ( as i do with any product ) and figured out how to organize separate playlists within minutes . 
##my sister was able to figure it out on her own as well , and she is of average computer competence . 
##the less computer-saavy might find apple 's software a bit friendlier , though ( i use it at a friend 's house and it does do a lot more for you . ) 
price[+3]##lastly , the price is fantastic : 
##i spent $ 269 for my 30gb zx , compared to the $ 299 for a 10gb ipod and the also expensive iriver ihp-120 . 
##for prospective buyers , i would warn of the following : 1 ) purchase a better pair of headphones as soon as possible , as earbuds sound terrible and are terribly uncomfortable ( this applies to earbuds in general , ) and 2 ) make sure that your mp3s have id3 tags on them , that when when they are loaded into the playlist they will automatically sort themselves . 
##if you want great sound quality , do n't want to spend an arm and a leg per-gigabyte , do n't mind being something of an iconoclast among many ipod users , and are willing to sacrifice a few cubic centimeters of your personal space for a large discount , then i would suggest the zen xtra for you . 
[t] it 's pretty good . 
##read the instuctions - do not plug the zen into your computer until you have installed all the software onto your computer and rebooted it ! ! 
##( i had no problems since i did this but there seem to be a couple of very bitter reviews further down - maybe they did not do this or maybe there are some very sad ipod owners since they all recomend it instead ) . 
##and have you seen the price of the ipod extras that you need . 
##eg 60 $ for a plastic box to hold 4 aaa batteries to increase the use time past 6-8 hrs ( reviewers figures ) 
software[+2]##i uploaded the drivers and new software in 15 minutes - no crashes or problems . 
##transferred the zens new software onto it in about 10 seconds . 
##it is transferes a song in about 2 seconds . 
usb 2.0[+3]##usb 2.0 - very fast 
earbud[-3]##yeah i agree the earbuds are pretty crap , replace them . 
sound[+3]##but the sound is very good ( and loud ) and works well on my portable speakers . 
recharger[+1]##and for those that are intrested the recharger works anywhere in the world ( and is quite small ). 
look[+3],size[+2][u],weight[+2][u]##it looks very cool , and seems quite small to me and very light . 
scroll[+1]##the scroll button seems ok , i have no problems with it . 
player[+3][u]##i am very pleased so far . 
##i had all my files already on my pc in wma format ( 200 cd 's ). 
##so far so good , no problems , no conversions . 
use[+3]##very simple to use . 
##the reason it does not get 5 stars 
battery[-1]##1 ) a spare battery would have been great . 
game[-1]##2 ) no games - it has a cool screen - why not use it . 
work[-1]##3 ) it does not work automatically like a hard drive when you connect it to your computer , like some players 
use[+3]##all in all suprisingly easy to use . 
[t] a great player for the price . 
##summary : 
sound quality[+3],size[+2],price[+2]##lots of flaws , but exceptional sound quality , hd size , and price make it a good buy . 
##pros : 
sound[+2]##excellent sound - i found the music reproduced faithfully through the jukebox . 
##there was no distortion and it sounded great , especially with eax environmental audio enabled . 
transfer[+2]##transfer through windows explorer - windows recognizes the jukebox as an additional hard disk , so it allows you to simply drag and drop files from windows explorer to a folder for the nomad . 
##i found this to be a much easier method of transferring my music to the nomad than using their software . 
##however , it does n't register instantly as a hard drive like other players . 
##you have to install the software to the computer you 're transferring to , instead of just connecting it with a usb connection . 
##this would have been much easier . 
##the nomad can hold any type of file , not just mp3 , so you can use it as a portable hard disk . 
transfer[+3]##i found it very useful for transferring large files to another computer . 
##this almost made it worth the price alone . 
##i was able to easily copy 2gb worth of video files from my computer , and then transfer them to a friend 's . 
storage[+3]##huge storage space - even at 320kbs , you can store a ton of songs on this thing . 
##30gb is more than enough for most people . 
transfer[+2]##having usb 2.0 makes for very fast transfers . 
##it only took me about 10 seconds to transfer a 200mb file . 
##it took maybe 15 minutes to transfer 1000 songs . 
##cons : 
navigation[-2]##navigation system - the zen xtra uses id3 tags that are embedded in the mp3 files to organize your songs . 
##this is great as long as all of your music have id3 tags , and if you 've downloaded your songs off the internet , many probably do n't . 
##it would have been much easier to use a windows explorer style navigation system . 
##you can 't simply open up a folder from the player and play all the songs in it . 
##whe you transfer your songs to the jukebox , it dumps all of them into a single folder , and then sorts them by the id3 tags. 
fm receiver[-2]##fm receiver - it has none . 
##i would be nice to have a simple fm receiver so i could pick up local stations . 
##that way i could get rid of a walkman alltogether . 
construction[-2]##cheap construction - they should have made the player out of hard plastic and put some rubber on the corners . 
feel[-1]##the player feels very delicate , as if i 'm holding an actual hard drive . 
##i 'm not sure if it would survive a fall from 3 feet . 
feel[-1]##as a portable player , it should feel a bit more durable . 
##the top of the player is a thin metal piece that covers up the battery and is removable . 
##i could crush this thing in half with two fingers if i wanted to . 
##this is not a player you can take jogging . 
play[-2]##the songs do n't play one after another like on a cd . 
##you have to add them to the playing list . 
##i can 't simply bring up my entire list of songs , click play , and then hit next . 
##you have to add all the songs to a play list . 
##there is probably an easier way to do this , i just have n't found it yet . 
software[-3]##software - the software is crap . 
rip cd[+2]##i use it for ripping cds , which it does a pretty good job of . 
software[-3][p]##otherwise , it is difficult to figure out and awkward . 
##like most people , i do n't want to read the instructions , i just want to use it . 
instruction[-1]##even after reading some of the instructions , it 's still hard to figure out . 
##i would recommend replacing the existing software with the " notmad explorer , " which is simpler to use and can be found on the internet . 
line out jack[-1]##no line out jack - as i said , there is none . 
##the headphone jack acts as a pseudo line out jack . 
##so you can plug your nomad directly into your stereo or use a car adapter , but you do n't get the quality from a true line out jack . 
line out jack[-1]##it sounds decent , but i would estimate you get maybe 80 % of the quality that you would from a true line out jack . 
control[-2]##controls are a bit awkward . 
##the controls definately took some getting used to . 
control[-2][u]##it was n't as easy to fast forward or pause a song than it was with a regular walkman . 
##when i first had it i kept finding myself having to look at the nomad to figure out where the skip button was . 
##a sliding old fashioned volume knob would also have been easier than the digital version that was included . 
##i want to have instant access to the volume , not have to hold down a button and have to wait a half second for the player to register it . 
headphone[-3]##crappy headphones . 
earbud[-2]##the included earbuds were uncomfortable . 
##i would replace them with some better sounding and more comfortable phones . 
navigation[-3]##difficult navigation - i wo n't necessarily say " difficult , " but i do n't enjoy the scrollwheel to navigate . 
navigation[-2]##it is a bit cumbersome , and i can 't get to the songs i want as quickly . 
navigation[-3][p]##i think this is it 's biggest flaw . 
##i would much more have preferred a keypad-type navigator like found on dvd remotes . 
control[-1]##up , down , left , and right would have given me better control . 
scroll wheel[-2]##if you hold down the scroll wheel too long ( which is common if you have a lot of songs to sort through ) , it will get " stuck " rapidly going through the songs and wo n't stop until several seconds after you let your finger off of it . 
##case - the nomad comes with a leather holding case . 
case[-1]##it would have been much nicer if it had a window so you could see the screen , and if the button did n't cover up the ac jack . 
##that way i could keep it in the case all the time . 
case[-3]##as it stands now , the case is pretty useless unless you 're packing the player up for travel , or if you load up all your songs beforehand . 
##you can cut up the case a bit with an xacto knife and make it useable though . 
player[+2][p]##overall , i feel that it 's a decent buy , and am happy that i own it . 
sound[+2], price[+2], player[-1]##i am willing to overlook it 's problems to get superior sound quality and low price , although i feel the player has a lot of room for improvement . 
[t] good for the money , but software is awful . 
##after looking over multiple large mp3 players , i decided to get this one . 
price[+2]##for the price and size and features , you can 't beat the price . 
##a 10 gb ipod is just as much and i have heard from multiple sources that the ipod is very loud and you can heard the hard drive everytime it spins , accesses files or does antyhing . 
##i think the reson for the creative being larger is for sound dampening and protection , whihc is a plus , but then again it is only speculation . 
button[+3],interface[+3]##the buttons and interface are very easy to use . 
click buttons[+3], display[+2]##simple click buttons , back buttons volume and display are very easy to read , access and use . 
software[-2]##but the major problem i had was with the software . 
##you are not able to simply import files , but rather you have to go through multiple steps to find them . 
instruction[-2]##the instructions that come with it do n't explain how to make things simple . 
sync[-2]##the quick sync is n't any good becuase it either needs to be configured properly or just is n't very useful . 
transfer[-2]##i tried to make sense of the file transfer program and just got more confused . 
##i tried to take a cd and simply rip it onto a hard drive and then transfer into the player . 
##well that was not a simple task . 
##i ended up suing windows player to make mp3 's ( actually wma files ) and then using the probram to transfer . 
##i think the lack of the mp3 player being able to run without special software is also a downer , becuase it makes it more cumbersome for people less computer illiterate . 
##buy this for the storage and price , avoid it if you know nothing about computers . 
[t] buy this instead of an ipod . 
mp3 player[+2]##with this mp3 player you get much more memory for much less than an ipod . 
##an ipod with the same amount of memory is $ 150 cheaper . 
##the reason for this the ipod has " a better user interface " . 
interface[+3]##i have found that the interface on the nomad is very easy to use if you have a basic knowledge of a computer . 
##also the ipod has games on it . 
##games are ok for a cell phone , but mp3 's are for music . 
[t] this thing roxxorz . 
##i purchased this player last week . 
##i did a little research on the web and this is the player i decided on . 
##i refuse to buy anything made by apple and the nomad is about $ 200 cheaper anyway . 
product[+2]##i have had no problem what-so-ever with this product . 
software[+2]##the software installed flawlessly and without any problems on my windows 2k machine . 
headphone[-1]##the headphones are n't the best , but you can really expect much out of the small headphones you insert in the ear cavity . 
battery life[+2]##the battery life seems good , takes very lttle time to charge , it uploads mp3s quickly and there is no delay between songs . 
navigation[+2]##took me a few tries to get use to the navigation , but it 's a very user friendly player imo . 
player[+2]##i have n't messed with the firmware at all , the player worked perfect for me right out of the box . 
product[+2]##all-in-all , this is another excellent creative product . 
##if you have the money and need 40 gb , this is the player for you . 
size[+1][u],weight[+1][u],look[+2],display[+2]##it 's small , light and nice looking and the display is decent as well . 
product[+2]##i would recommend this product to anyone . 
[t] it does n't get any better than this . 
player[+3]##before asking for the zen xtra specifically for christmas i researched many different mp3 players but finally decided on this one , and now that i have it i could n't be happier and i 'm convinced it 's the best one out there . 
software[+2]##many people have written about the software being its one downfall , personally i have n't had a single problem with the software , i 'm running windows me . 
cd rip[+3]##the cd ripping to mp3 is so easy , and you can even rip the cd directly to the mp3 player , so it wo n't take up space on your pc hard drive . 
software[+2]##the software runs smooth , it 's nice to look at , it 's very organized , easy to follow and makes things very simple . 
control[+2]##the controls on the player are very simple , no need for a manual . 
player[+2],sound[+3]##the player is fast and sounds great , it also has many options like slowing or speeding up the music , or making it sound like you 're hearing the music in a huge auditorium . 
battery[+2]##the battery lasts very long when playing music , but writing files to the player drains the battery fast , so you need to have it plugged into an outlet when sending files . 
playlist[+2]##playlists can be made on the fly , without aid of a computer , and you can use play modes like shuffle and repeat for your ' now playing ' selections or playlists . 
software[+3],player[+3]##the software could n't be better and the mp3 player works like a dream , i could n't give this anything but a 5 , i wish there was a 6 . 
[t] difficult to manage large library . 
##i purchased and returned this product , but not because of any glaring flaws in the design . 
player[+3][p]##it is an extremely cool gizmo . 
##in fact , everyone who saw it thought i was " the man " and wo n't believe i returned it . 
##so what 's the problem ? 
##i made the mistake of thinking i could easily manage my mp3 library with this device . 
##i initially loaded about 3700 tracks with the intent of ripping the majority of my remaining cds to mp3 . 
##i quickly discovered that the nomad was n't going to work for me . 
##the reasons below will be true for any product in this category . 
##here 's why : 
##1 . i do n't need the nomad at the office . 
##i have my mp3 's stored on my workstation . 
##2 . i do n't need the nomad at home for the same reason ( although using it to sync between the two pc 's might be a reason enough to get it . ) 
##3 . it 's a hazard in the car . 
navigation[+2],scroll[-2]##the navigation is nice enough , but scrolling and searching through thousands of tracks , hundreds of albums or artists , or even dozens of genres is not conducive to save driving . 
##( throw a cell phone and you 're asking for trouble . ) 3a . 
playlist[-2]##creating playlists using the included software to minimize issue 3 was n't as easy as i would have liked . 
##the bottom line : 
##if i have to get into making playlists to avoid rear-end collisions , i 'll just buy a regular portable cd/mp3 player and burn myself collections of about 120 tracks per disk . 
##sure it 's " old school " to carry a cd wallet around , but it will be easier to manage and i 'll save around 250 bucks . 
##one major complaint : 
sound quality[-2]##my only significant complaint is sound quality . 
eax[-2]##the eax sound enhancement feature did n't do enough for me and the custom eq was a limited 5 band eq . 
##this did not give me enough control . 
##i wanted to use the nomad with a cassette style car adapter . 
sound quality[-2]##i was unable achieve a sound quality on par with my simple portable cd player with " bass boost . " 
##the sound quality of my cd player is superior in this setting to the nomad . 
##one minor complaint : 
##the documentation says to extend battery life , do not fill player to capacity . 
##gee ... thanks a lot creative . 
[t] great product . 
##well in the beginning i was asking around for mp3 players . 
##so then i came across the ipod ( 10 gb ) . 
##so i was all excited about the ipod but then the day before i went to best buy to check out the other mp3 players and i came across this one . 
##well i decided to get this one . 
product[+3]##well i have to say that this product is very good i mean it might be a little big but it still fits in your pocket . 
product[+2]##well surely this is a product that i recommend someone in getting rather than any other mp3 player ( at that size and the price ) . 
program[-2]##well just one con - its not really plug and play at first i mean its very confusing to start the program but one you do it , it will be a breeze . 
##enjoy . 
[t] in a word ... amazing i got this for christmas . 
##i was going to get a 10gb ipod , but after looking at the 10 day warranty for ipod and www.ipodsdirtysecret.com ( battery lasts 18 months ; 
##it costs like 200 dollars to replace - now you mail it off to get the battery replaced for like 99 .. . 
##what a big improvement ... lol ) and the fact that lots of people have had problems with ipods on windows computers , i realized this is a much better buy . 
price[+2][u], player[+2]##not only is it more affordable , but its a better player for windows , which is what i have . 
##anyway , on with the review . 
##so far i 've only had it since christmas , so i cant tell you much about the battery life . 
battery life[+2]##it hasnt gone below the second notch ( i charge mine whenever i 'm at home and not using it ) , so the battery life seems fine ( so far ). 
##software : for the people who complain about software , please , stop complaining . 
##once you hook the thing up to the computer ( via the usb cable ) , the machine instantly recognizes the fact that it 's there & installs the drivers . 
##from there , you transfer files from your computer to the mp3 player ( with the help of the media sniffer .. . read the manual ). 
id3 tag[-2]##my only complaint would be that you need id3 tags & that takes a while to do if your mp3 files do n't have them . 
##if you 're copying cds with windows media , its really simple to give your songs id3 tags , so thats what i do . 
transfer[+2]##oh ... and file transfers are fast & easy . 
##the player : it 's silver . 
weight[-1]##a little weighty ( 9 ounces ... no biggie ) , but otherwise fine . 
##people complain about the scroll wheel , but its not a big deal at all ( though it is just a little annoying at times ) . 
scroll wheel[+1]##it 's easy . 
button[+2]##the buttons are easy to use , and its easy to navigate . 
backlight[+2]##the big backlight makes things easy to see , and the writing is big enough for people to see . 
eax[+2]##my favorite thing about the nomad is the eax feature . 
##you can customize bass , etc. like usual , but also you can customize the sound of the player ( like how it would sound in a concert hall , jazz club , etc ). 
eax[+3][p]##its really cool . 
sound quality[+3]##sound quality is amazing. i was expecting worse , but its really good ( especially if your files have good sound quality ) . 
song speed[+3]##you can also slow a song down & speed it up , which is cool too . 
earbud[-3]##but the earbuds suck ! 
##buy new ones asap. every time you move your face or something they pop out . 
##for a 250 dollar player , they could have thrown in nice headphones . 
##a remote would have been cool too ... but lets not push it . 
##oh ... one more thing . 
case[-2]##i forgot , the case does n't fit . 
case[-2]##my case doesnt close ... maybe mine was just faulty , but the case isnt that great . 
##so far the player froze on me once ( i started pushing buttons before it loaded ) but since is hard drive based - you have to expect that . 
##so all you do is stick a pin or something small in the reset button & you 're golden . 
storage[+2][u]##also , you can store data on it , which is a plus. for all you people who want to buy an ipod just to say you have an ipod , do n't bother , this is a much better buy . 
##hope i helped ! 
[t] simply doesnt shine . 
##i 'd like to start off saying that before this product i was using an archos jukebox recorder .. . 
##what made this product so great to me was the open source os called rockbox .. . 
##based on hardware one could assume the archos players were horrible ( which by hardware standards .. . they were ) .. . 
##but because a few fine men and women took the time to create the upstanding rockbox software , the archos became a top notch player for me with intuitive features out the wazoo .. . 
##now we come to the zen xtra .. . 
player hardware[+2]##first i 'll start off by saying that this players hardware is pretty good .. . 
sound[+3],size[-1][u]##the sound is indeed excellent and the form factore is not bad ( but still rather larger than i had expected ) .. . 
software[-2]##what really made this a mediocre mp3 player for me was the software . 
##not just the transfer software ( which was a hellishly horrible experience ) but also the player 's software . 
##first of all , many actions that the player utilizes do n't make sense . . 
bookmark[-2]##bookmarks for example , are an excellent feature ... but not on this player .. . 
bookmakr[-2]##rather than creating a directory for bookmarks to be found in one area , the user must actually find the track where the bookmark was made . . 
bookmark[-2]##this makes no sense and sort of defeats the purpose of audio bookmarks .. . 
playlist[-3]##the dynamic playlists ( " now playing " , i belive creative calls it ) feels very awkward at times and some menus simply take to long to get to and operate .. . 
##well , anyway i could go on and on on why this player did n't meet my expectations .. . 
##i 'll just say this .. . 
##for the average music listener not expecting much ... this may be a satisfactory mp3 player ... 
##but for someone who cares about thier music collection and wants fluid and responsive playback .. . i can 't recommend this product . 
[t] excellent product with a few minor problems . 
##i became interested in getting a mp3 player when i got a new work computer ; while my office bars the addition of any non-work software , it does n't care if you load cds onto the hard drive . 
##over time , i loaded hundreds of cds onto the computer , and the idea of carrying around all of my music with me became attractive . 
##many people recommended the ipod , and i borrowed one from a friend . 
price[+2][u]##while the ease of use was very impressive , i was put off by the price -- about $ 130 more than what i paid amazon for this player . 
##also , there is the need to send the ipod to replace the batteries when they die ( which they will ). 
nomad[+3]##i have had the nomad jukebox for about three weeks now , and i am very happy with it . 
weight[-1][u],battery life[+1]##it 's only slightly heavier than the ipod , and has a longer battery life . 
storage capacity[+2]##the storage capacity is great for me -- 
##i have a large but not huge cd collection and have loaded everything i want to listen to on it and still have 13 gigabytes free . 
control[-1]##the controls are somewhat harder to use than the ipod , but i have gotten use to them , and even at the beginning did not think would justify the huge difference in price . 
load[-1][u]##loading cds was somewhat time-consuming , but i think it would have been with the ipod as well . 
##i had never loaded my cds on to my home computer , using my work computer instead . 
##my office would not let me put the software on to my work computer . 
##this meant that i had to take all my cds and do in a fairly short period of time what i had done over a year at work . 
##if the music had been on my home computer , the transfer would have been accomplished very quickly . 
##i have an older computer , running windows 98 se , and so those of you with something more recent would find the process even quicker . 
tag[-1],software[-1]##my only reservations about this product concern the tagging process and the way it interacts with the software . 
##when you load a disc , you go to an internet cite for the insertion of the names for the cd and the tracks . 
##while the listing process is accurate for track names ( unlike windows ' reliance on the amg , which frequently gets track listings out of order ) , the results can be odd . 
##the cd will be classified into a number of genres , and in multidisk sets , you can get separate classifications for different disks by the same artist and the same performance . 
##for example , jimi hendrix 's 2 cd live at the fillmore east had one cd classifed as classic rock and the other psychidelic rock . 
##perhaps the weirdest was one of bruce springsteen 's cds from the tracks set being classified as goth rock . 
##you can change any of these , but need to be paying attention when the information is downloaded before you copy it . 
##a somewhat more troublesome problem is that the internet site will sometimes give different discs of the same set slightly different names . 
##this will cause the discs not to show up together when you are looking for them on the nomad . 
##again , you can change this , but it 's harder to spot a minor variation in the title when you do n't have the title of the other disk in front of you . 
tag[-2]##other tagging problems result ( i think ) from the nomad 's operating system . 
##if you have two tracks with exactly the same name on one disk , it will not copy both -- it gives you the option of skipping the second or overwriting the first with the second . 
##this is rarely a problem with any kind of popular music , but can be troublesome with classical music where tracks are identified by tempi . 
##i also had it happen when recording a jazz set where there were a number of outtakes of the same song without numbering them separately . 
##the way to fix this is to rename the track by adding a number yourself to the end of the track listing . 
software[-2]##also , i can 't understand why the software does not ignore " the " when it lists the cds in alphabetical order . 
playlist[-2]##finally , making playlists from the computer can be complicated because the tracks are listed individually , and are organized by cd , which are not listed but are organized in alphabetical order . 
##in other words , to locate a track using the software on the computer and add it to a playlist , you must know the name of the cd it appears on and then find the track by locating the location of the unlisted cd by looking for tracks that appear on it . 
##you do n't have this problem if you make your playlist from the nomad , where cds are listed separately . 
##you need your computer , however , if you want to add tracks to a playlist . 
##these are minor problems , and i list them to save anyone else the trouble of discovering them . 
##had i not been in such a hurry to load cds , i would have spotted them sooner . 
##also , if i had already loaded and tagged by cds on my home computer , this would not have been an issue . 
product[+3][p]##the bottom line for me is that i am very happy with this product . 
##apple 's ipod is dominant now , but i have to wonder whether the price differential will mean that in 3 or 4 years its market share will drop significantly . 
[t] poor substitute for an ipod . 
##simply not as friendly for functional as an ipod . 
##even better , ipod integrates perfectly with itunes so that managing music is a snap . 
[t] zen versus ipod . 
##i just got a 40gb ipod to replace my zen ( a 20gb model ) . 
##while the ipod 's form factor is much nicer , here 's where the zen is better . 
##software : 
software[+2]##a lot of people complain about the creative software , but i actually find creative mediasource organizer to have some strengths over itunes . 
sync[+1]##first , the zen lets you sync to more than one computer . 
##the ipod is a one way only machine - from computer to player . 
shuttle[+3]##the zen is an outstanding way to shuttle music between sources , you can 't do this on the ipod ( except for a cumbersome work-around using the ipod as a hard drive instead of a player ) . 
sync[+1]##second , the " automatic " sync on creative lets you review the songs before it begins its transfer . 
##since the ipod lacks this review feature on its auto-sync and it only allows one-way transfers , the first time i connected my ipod to my laptop , i wiped out the 20gb of music i had transferred from my desktop to the ipod . 
##if the hard drive on your computer should fail , better have your music backed up somewhere or its gone ! 
player[+2]##the zen serves as a back-up device as well as a player . 
software[+1]##third , creative software allows you to keep two windows open to look at both the content on the player and the computer . 
cd burner[-2]##only thing missing from creative is a cd burner . 
##lastly , ipod / itunes will not play wma formatted songs . 
##if you have a lot of those , be prepared to convert to mp3 . 
##itunes does what apple is famous for , makes software that works for the less computer saavy . 
creative[+2]##for those of us that like to tinker , i think creative offers some advantages . 
##player controls : 
##here 's where the ipod drives me nuts . 
##the player controls are too easy to hit accidentally . 
##if you happen to push the wrong button , you can wipe out the order of songs you had put in . 
##the ipod also does not let you see what 's coming up next on the player . 
scroll[+1]##zen allows you to scroll up and down the song list selected on the player . 
remove[+1]##it also lets you remove songs from the play order . 
delete[+1]##if you bring up an album , but absolutely hate some of the tracks , the zen will allow you to delete that from the playing order . 
##you have to skip to the next track when your hated song comes up with the ipod . 
##lastly , you cannot manage anything on the ipod itself . 
##while you can create a temporary playlist , you can 't store it permanently , delete songs , search very easily , etc. 
##none of these features are available because of the ipod 's 1-way transfers - you cannot make changes on the ipod that are premanent . 
##again , the ipod is a beautiful thing to look at and touch , player controls are less functional . 
##i think the ipod versus zen typifies differences between apple and win machines . 
##win software can be a little cranky , but much more easier to customize to your needs . 
##with apple , you get a good product , but you get it the way apple wants you to have it . 
##if i had to do this again , i might get the 40gb zen . 
zen[+3][p]##its ability to serve as a back-up for my music collection is a huge plus. 
[t] excellent alternative . 
this thing[+3][p]##i got this thing for christmas and i have been very happy with it ever since . 
##i was planning on getting an ipod , but i changed my mind last minute ... mostly because of the whole battery issue , i do n't have the patience for those sorta things . 
##my cuzin got an ipod and i wo n't say it is an awful product , but i will say that for the price , apple could do better as far as storage and battery life goes . 
control[-2],look[-2]##the only thing i would complain about the zen xtra is that the controls are n't as easy as the ipod 's , or as " sexy " looking . 
[t] excellent . 
##i got this player for christmas & this was my first time using an mp3 player . 
##i have a large collection of cds and have loaded over 100 of them so far . 
software[+3]##the software is quick & easy to use & i found the entire process very easily mastered . 
headphone[-3]##as mentioned in other reviews the headphones are useless and need to be replaced right away ! 
the unit[+2]##the unit works great with my cassette adapter for my car & is also easily worked without taking your eyes off the road ! 
##i have tried the belkin tunecast mobile fm transmitter but found there was too much interference . 
unit[+2]##overall it is a great unit & hopefully creative labs or some other vendor will soon come out with some accessories for it . 
[t] review for folks new to mp3s . 
##i purchased this mp3 player just last night after doing some scouting around . 
##here 's a basic run-down from what i learned : 
##flash card memory vs. hard drive ( i.e. why does a 256 mb player cost $$$...and a 40 gb ( 40,000 mb ) player only cost 
##mp3 players have either flash card memory or a hard drive in them . 
##the flash card memory is more expensive but is very light and compact . 
##that 's why you have these things that can be keychain size . 
##tiny ! 
##mp3 players of this kind of memory are typically small and light and have between 64 mb - 1.5 gb of memory . 
##i am averaging 4.5 mb per song , to give you an idea of how many songs you can get by the amount of memory . 
##( 1 gb = 1,000 mb ) 
##hard drives ( this is what most ipods have - and just about all mp3 players over 3-5 gb of memory ) . 
##cheaper to produce , holds a lot , heavier and has moving parts which means it 's a little more prone to damage from being banged around . 
##that said , they are pretty sturdy machines and i would n't let this dissuade you from getting an mp3 with a lot of memory . 
##just be aware of it . 
##this explains why you see what appears to be such weird pricing on mp3 players . 
##a 256 mb player ( roughly 60 songs for me ) is about x amount of dollars but a 30 gb ( 30,000 mb ) player ( roughly 6,650 songs ) sells for only slightly more . 
##it 's because the 256 player uses flash memory ( smaller / lighter ) and the 30gb uses a hard drive . 
##that 's the first thing to understand . 
##so consider what you 're going to use the device for . 
##if you 're a jogger and you want to strap it to your arm , i 'd recommend flash memory . 
##if you want to listen to tunes while you travel , i 'd get a hard drive because you can put so much on the thing - including audio books . 
##review of zen xtra - 40 gb 
##the device is larger than an ipod of similar capacity . 
size[+1]##this did n't bother me too much because it 's still a decent size . 
case[+2]##it comes with a good case that fits it snuggly . 
cover[-1]##the front cover ( which you remove to take out the battery ) feels flimsy but when snapped on , the device still feels pretty solid . 
##as some other reviewers noted , after it was connected to the computer for a bit , it somehow stopped reading the player so i had to replug it . 
##it did not lock up my computer or require a reboot . 
##the software lets you pop in a cd and then scans the internet to name the artist , track name and album name . 
software[+3][u]##extremely convenient . 
##then it rips the tunes into mp3s and puts them on your computer . 
##you can even skip that step and rip them directly from the cd to the player . 
##( wo n't leave copy on your computer . ) 
##the pros and cons of it : 
price[+2]##great price . 
##the ipod costs more for the same amount of memory . 
software[+2]##i thought the software was decent enough - it was n't complicated to learn at all . 
scroll[-1]##the scroll button is sort of annoying to push - a nice button would be nicer but eh , not a big deal . 
##it also stores data so i can see myself placing some data files on here . 
size[-1][u]##it is slightly larger than an ipod , no doubt about it . 
##for me , that was the only drawback . 
player[+3][p]##i 'm really happy with this purchase . 
##also , when i installed the software , it said that windows xp had n't approved something with the drivers , etc - and that continuing it install may cause instability . 
##if you 're like me , that will definitely make you pause . 
##after i reviewed the manual ( a pdf file included on the cd ) , i felt better because they warned you about the message and said it would n't cause problems and , in fact , it has n't . 
##so if you have xp , be prepared for this and do n't be alarmed . 
##if you are out for an mp3 player with a lot of memory and do not want to spend a ton of money , i think this is a great purchase and strongly recommend it . 
size[-1]##i would have liked to have given it 4 1/2 stars docking that 1/2 star only for the size . 
[t] what a beast . 
##i got this a while ago knowing nothing about it . 
##it is a beast . 
##if i wasnt a runner i would take a bullet in the foot for my nomad jukebox . 
screen[+3],equilizer[+2]##now heres the stuff you should know starting with the good things : the screen is really big and the blue light in the back is perfect , fast as hell in music transfer , controls are easy to use after mastering the scroll button , great sound and ive heard many mp3 players , a ton of different equilizer type deals on here . 
size[-1][u],weight[+1],software[-1]##there are a couple things i didnt like though but nothing serious : a little larger than other mp3s but still light , the software takes some time to get used to ( maybe 10-15 mins ) , and this thing would definitely be destroyed with one fall . 
case[+1]##but it comes with a tank of a case and if you cut a piece out where the screen is you can always keep it in the case and still access everything . 
price[+2],sound[+2]##ive seen em all , the archos , dell , ipods , everything ... good price and great sound makes this one the best in my opinion . 
[t] yet another inferior knockoff . 
##granted this is cheaper than an ipod . 
##cheaper in every way . 
weight[-2][u],size[-2][u]##its far heavier and much larger which might not seem to matter except if you use it while running or keep it in your pocket . 
playlist[-2]##its far more difficult to select songs and has no easy to use on the fly playlist creation such as the new ipod not to mention it does n't sinc with contact lists , phone numbers , address books , ect. like the ipod ( which eliminated my need for any kind of palm device ) . 
battery life[-2]##it also has unproven battery life . 
##everyone who says i can 't buy the ipod because after excessive use in a short time ( the man who made the ipod battery life video admitted that he had used it extensively every day and charged fully every night for those 18 months , conditions under which any rechargeable battery dies . 
##use this for 18 months every day and see what happens , or look at a 2 year old electric razor and see if it holds the same charge as the first day you had it ) . 
##while it is an alternative to the ipod and one of the few viable ones its just that , an alternative and why would anyone seek an alternative to something that really needs no alternative choice because theres nothing wrong and everything right with it . 
##i 'd like to see how well a small company supports its mp3 player in 2 years when its battery dies as all rechargeable do . 
software[-3]##finally the software used to put all the songs into it is vastly inferior to itunes on two levels , first it is poorly integrated into the overall player and clunky to use especially with tagging and second the wma audio format sucks , flat out sucks in terms of sound quality compared with the vastly superior aac format the apple ipod uses and it sticks you with one of the sub par paid music services such as napster instead of allowing to use the itunes store , which , if you ever plan to pay for your music , is by far the best . 
##before anyone says hey you have n't used the product , i have , my friend received one for christmas instead of an ipod and has since envied me for my vastly superior product . 
[t] good player , bad software . 
##pros : 
price[+2],capacity[+2]##* price and capacity 
design[+2],interface[+1]##* slick-looking design and improved interface 
battery[+1]##* removable battery 
##cons : 
case[-3]##* protective case completely useless as is since it obscures display window . 
##had to cut out a window using a swiss army knife . 
##how did this gigantic flaw go unnoticed by creative ? 
scroll[-2]##* scroll button more cumbersome than on earlier models . 
##does n't always register push-button movement . 
eax[-2]##* eax equalizer accentuates dimished quality of mp3 files . 
##i have to rip everything as a 160 kbps wma file ( as opposed to 128 kbps mp3 ) to avoid hearing digital garbling . 
volume[-2]##* does not provide enough volume when connected to larger headphones , or external receivers ( car radio ). 
software[-3]##* software is absolutely terrible : 
transfer[-2]##-- > will not automatically transfer songs with identical titles ( if you have live albums or greatest hits albums , this will cause you inordinate frustration ). 
recognition[-1]##-- > does not recognize player at random times , despite being connected and displaying player 's library . 
change[-2]##-- > too difficult to change genre / album / track information for large number of tracks . 
software[-1]##-- > you 'll be changing track information a lot because the cd database information utilized by the software is mediocre at best . 
##if you have any multi-disc box sets , you 'll notice that the artist 's name , album name , and genre will often change with every disc . 
##final verdict : 
player[+2],software[-2], rip[-2], transfer[-2]##a good player at a great price with terrible software that makes ripping and transferring way more difficult than it should be . 
[t] excellent way to carry your music collection ! 
##after investigating a multitude of player options , i asked for and received the 60 gb zen xtra for christmas . 
size[+1][u]##despite its being slightly larger than the ipod , i must say i was surprised to see how small it was when i unwrapped the box ! 
cd rip[+2]##i am ripping my cd collection into 160 kbps wma files ; this gives an average of around 60-65 mb per cd , good for about 900 cds in the ~ 57,000 mb of free memory available to me . 
transfter[+2]##file transfers are fast , nearly a song per second via usb 2.0 . 
##several people have complained of difficulty transferring multiple songs with the same title . 
##this is possible ! ! 
##since the zen xtra does not use a folder structure , the " duplicate name " problem stems from the actual file name , not from the song 's title / artist / album . 
##solution ? 
##simply configure the mediasource software ( or windows media player , or your ripper-du-jour ) to create file names that include artist and ( especially ) album names in addition to track names . 
##using this method , i have not once encountered a situation where a track was rejected , and i have plenty of duplicate tracks on live and compilation albums . 
##even if there happened to be identical track titles on the same disc , you could still edit the file name manually and get them both onto the player . 
software[-2]##my one issue with the mediasource software is that , despite pulling id3 tag data from the cdds service , the ripping process fails to populate the " year " field . 
##weird . 
##how does it sound ? 
sound[+3]##to my ears , a 160 kbps wma file sounds just as good as the source cd , and the zen xtra sounds just as good as a portable cd player . 
##no complaints there . 
eax[+2]##the eax features are pretty cool , as well , as creative has included a number of eq adjustments that , for example , compensate for the extraneous noise encountered in a car or on a train . 
navigation[-1]##navigation could be better , but there is n't really anything the zen xtra can 't do once you 've gotten comfortable with it . 
player[+2]##at the end of the day , what i wanted was a large-capacity player which allows me to easily play any album from my collection wherever i go , and the zen xtra 's combination of price , capacity and features easily meets those criteria . 
[t] cd collection in your pocket . 
this[+2][p]##i got this for christmas , and it is a great gift . 
use[+2]##i have been ripping songs into it for the past few weeks , and the ease of use is wonderful . 
memory[+2]##the memory will hold an amazing amount of songs , my entire collection of cd 's will all fit on this great little tiny piece of digital fun . 
battery[+2],sound[+3]##plusses are the easy to remove battery and the terrific sound produced by the nomad . 
software[-2],case[-2]##the only two things that stop me from giving it 5 stars are the ho-hum software that comes with the system , and the traveling case it comes with . 
##this is a powerful piece of equipment . 
##it is great to no longer wonder what music i want to take with me for a cross country flight or a two week trip - now i just take everything . 
rip[+2], quality[+2]##ripping the songs , even with my 1.1 usb connection is still very quick , and the quality is very good . 
player[+2]##considering the price and specs , this might be the best buy out there for a large memory mp3 player . 
##before jumping on the ipod train , take a look at this marvel . 
[t] buy an extended warranty - you 'll need it ! 
##i 'll state up front that i do not own a zen xtra and have not used one at all . 
##but you might find my review useful , nonetheless . 
##i purchased a jukebox 3 from creative almost a year ago . 
##two months ago , an internal part failed ( not due to customer abuse ; it just failed ) . 
##i got an rma from creative , sent my player in to them for repairs . 
##it took them twice as long to get to my unit as they said . 
##moreover , they want a total of $ 107 to repair it . 
##( this includes the $ 20 that you have to pay up front , just to get them to look at your player . ) 
##if creative offered a 12-month warranty on their mp3 players , i 'd be covered . 
##but they offer only a 3-month warranty ( on all of their players , including the zen xtra ) . 
##so i 'm screwed . 
##but you do n't have to be . 
##if you buy a creative mp3 player , be sure to get the optional extended warranty . 
##or better yet , buy from another company that stands behind their products with a 12-month warranty . 
sound quality[+2]##it 's really a shame , because otherwise , creative mp3 players are very good , and have the best sound quality of any players on the market . 
[t] the best ipod alternative . 
##i shopped around for a while before buying a hard-drive mp3 player . 
##i read reviews , compared specs , and visited user forums . 
##despite all the hype about ipods , i knew i wanted something different , because i wanted more storage than the ipod i could afford would offer , and because i wanted more flexibility in where i purchased music online . 
zen xtra[+2]##after some consideration i chose the 40gb nomad zen xtra from creative , and i have not been disappointed . 
##i purchased it at a retail store , and got an extended warranty . 
battery[+2]##first , the battery is replacable by the user , because creative intended it to be - unlike apple with the ipod . 
battery[+2]##it was easy enough to remove the front plate , and there was only one way the battery could be inserted . 
##creative also sells batteries via its website , so there 's no shipping off my player and waiting for it to be sent back to me with the new battery . 
software[+3]##the new organizer software that ships with the nomad zen xtra could n't be easier to use . 
##point the " media sniffer " to your music files and let it do the rest . 
playlist[+1],cd rip[+1]##you can create playlists , drag & drop songs and playlists to your player , and rip directly from cd to your player . 
transfer[+3]##and with usb 2.0 , transferring music to your player is incredibly easy . 
##you can also delete songs from the player itself , and create playlists - on the fly - on your player . 
sound[+2],volume[+2]##the sound is great , and the volume is more than satisfactory for commutes and shutting out external noise . 
earbud[+2]##i thought i 'd have to buy a set of headphones to use with it , but the included earbuds work quite well . 
earbud[+1][p]##they could be more comfortable , but no complaints in the sound department . 
equalizer[+2]##i 've played around with the equalizer settings and am satisfied at the range of choices i have there too . 
##there are plenty other features that i have n't checked out , but i 'm sure i soon will . 
##it ships with a carrying case that has a belt clip on it . 
clip[-1]##however , i do n't like to carry it on my belt because the clip is n't secure and the case can slip off . 
##it happened to me once . 
##so now i keep it in my pocket . 
case[-2]##also , the carrying case that came with mine covers up the display , so even though the side controls are reachable , i have to open it up to see the display . 
##it would have been better to have some sort of window on teh carrying case , so you could see the display without opening it . 
##that 's my only real complaint about the nomad zen xtra , though . 
[t] important zen information . 
player[-3],software[-2]##this player is an overall disappointment with a couple of big flaws that potential buyers should be wary of ; and all readers need to know about a third party software company that resolves virtually all of the creative mediasource file transfer issues . 
##zen good points : 
storage[+1][u]##1 . i achieved my basic objective ; my entire cd collection is on a portable device with lots of room to store more . 
##2 . most mp3 players have a gap between the end of one track and the start of the next ; it 's annoying in music that is intended to be continuous . 
stoppage[+1]##the zen has minimal stoppage between tracks ; when listening to music that continues from one track to the next the gap is just a hesitation - a slightly audible click ; if i am not listening for the progress from one track to the next i do n't even notice the click . 
##flaws : 
software[-1]##1. creative mediasource software is ok to rip , catalog & burn music if you are starting from scratch ; but i used musicmatch to rip my cds before i bought the zen ( 278 cds ; 3,400 tracks ; 12.5 gb of music all ripped at 128bps ) and guess what ? 
mediasource[-2]##mediasource did not recognize my tags ! 
##my choices at that moment were to manually re-tag my music or re-rip using mediasource . 
##i do n't think so . 
##btw , if you * are * ripping your cds , mediasource accesses the cddb music catalog over the internet and the few cds i experimented with all provided good quality [ correct & uncluttered ] tag information . 
eax[-2]##2 . despite most reviewers giving kudos to the zen for music quality , i experienced a flaw using eax . 
##after about 45 mins of listening there was audible static in the player . 
##when i turned eax off the static disappeared . 
##when i turned eax back on the static was also not present . 
eax[-2]##creative are * the * sound people for computers , i can 't understand why eax would introduce static . 
##is eax faulty ?
##is my unit defective ? 
##was i just unlucky at that moment ? 
##was it a full moon that night ? 
##i have n't figured it out yet . 
mediasource[-3]##3 . mediasource is an application with serious user interface flaws . 
##do not underestimate this in your purchase decision . 
##many reviewers refer to it as " clunky " or " difficult " - heed their warnings . 
##some amazon reviewers say it corrrupted their music files ; 
##i did n't use it long enough to know , but clearly you need to use it with caution . 
folder structure[-2]##4 .the zen * stores * data files , but does not allow a folder structure nor does it allow documents to be opened or programs to be launched from its disk ( they must be copied to another hard drive to be launched ) . 
storage[-2]##in other words , the zen is not a convenient data storage device ; only buy the capacity you need for your music collection ( see point 1. for some sizing information ) . 
##my goal of using it as a music player * and * data storage device has not been met ; do n't make the same mistake . 
stop button[-2]##5 . the zen does not have a stop button ! 
##you can stop playback by pressing 2 buttons , first the pause button , then the " next track " or " previous track " button . 
manual[-2]##but this is * not documented * in the zen manual - neither the hard copy nor the cd version . 
##to discover this i had to read about 10 online reviews ( with many complaints about the lack of stop button ) before i found one reviewer who was smart enough to both figure it out & document it . 
usb recharge[-1]##6 . the zen nx battery requires the ac adapter to recharge ; it does not charge by usb cable ; this is not tragic , but usb recharging would be a convenient ( additional ) choice . 
##if you are buying a zen xtra check whether the battery recharges via usb ; it does not on the zen nx . 
mediasource[-2]##7 . mediasource did not install on my personal notebook . 
##it referred to a " microsoft jet database engine " error and the install program suggested i download a service pack from the ms website to fix the problem ; 
##i did that and re-installed the software but had the same error . 
##creative provided e-mail support ; 
##i followed their advice but that failed , too . 
##i experimented with installing mediasource on 2 other computers at home and it worked fine . 
##so it is probably " just bad luck " on my part that the personal notebook i own had this install error . 
##however , it did motivate me to find a work-around solution . 
##third party software to the rescue 
##after much frustration ( above ) i found the notmad explorer ; cute product name for software that resolves virtually all of the creative mediasource file transfer & organization problems . 
##i am not associated with the company , i am not providing a url , but search for notmad and you should find it pretty easily . 
##this provides drag & drop transfers of music between the computer & zen ; each time it transfers music to the zen it asks if you want to generate a playlist ; it allows playlists developed in other software to be transferred to the zen ( . 
notmad[+2]##m3u files are used by most mp3 players like musicmatch and winamp , but not creative - without notmad you need to manually recreate your playlists ) ; it does n't care what software you use to rip or catalog your music - creative or any other company - all my 12.5 gb of music were transferred to the zen with correct tags - hooray ! 
##notmad has other features too , but this is not an advertisement so please see the company 's web site for more information ... 
##conclusion : 
##if i knew then what i know now i would have paid the extra to get an ipod & avoided the zen . 
software[+2]##given that i already have the zen the only reason i am happy with it is because of the notmad software . 
##and i am hoping the static i heard when using eax was a blip ... 
##to summarize , i am using the creative zen as a mobile device ; 
##i am using musicmatch to rip & catalog ( and if i choose , download ) music ; 
##i am using notmad explorer to move music & playlists between the zen & my computer . 
##the only creative software i am using is the device driver ( s ). 
[t] how did i get by without this ? 
##this is one of those items that , at first glance , looked cool but did n't really ring a bell with me . 
player[+3][p]##now that i own it , however , i can 't imagine being without it ! 
memory[+2][u]##i have stored around 60 cd 's ( at 160kbps ) on this and have barely touched the available memory . 
sound quality[+3]##the sound quality is fantastic ( cd quality ) and it is really great to carry this around instead of stacks of cd 's or tapes ! 
navigation[+2]##it is exceedingly simple to navigate around in this device . 
operate[+2][u]##i did n't read a thing about how to operate it -- it was just intuitive . 
##i was cruising around the device within 20 minutes . 
software[-1]##the pc-side software can be goofy and takes a little getting used to but it 's not as bad as some reviewers have indicated . 
napster[+2]##one other plus is that napster now supports this device via their software . 
##my one recommendation to creative is to get some marketing people to work on the names of these things . 
name[-2]##they have a whole bunch of devices that all have the same-sounding name ( and they are long ) . 
##whereas some folks have the " ipod " , i have the " nomad jukebox zen xtra " ( not to be confused with the " nomad jukebox zen nx " ) . 
##minor gripe . 
##i can 't imagine why i would spend hundreds of dollars more to have an ipod . 
[t] great memory , quality ? 
player[-3][p]##i just bought one and returned it as defective for good reason . 
##in a quick summation , here is what i found . 
storage[+3][u]##+ the memory ( 40 gb ) is staggering . 
##i had downloaded about 1000 songs and had room for another 9000 ! 
##it may have taken several years to fill this up . 
musicmatch software[+2]##+ i had no problem using musicmatch software already on my computer to load songs and albums onto this unit 
screen[+2]##+ screen was good , easy to read 
sound quality[+2]##+ / - sound quality was good but it was going to take some tweakings with settings to try to make it great . 
software[-2]##- the software that came with it was tough to load . 
##i got weird messages about it not being ok 'd by microsoft ( or something like that ) , then i thought it failed to load , then it loaded . 
battery top[-2]##- the top that covered the battery kept poping off without much of a touch near the bottom latch . 
##not good if you 're taking this traveling . 
top[-2]##the top did not fit well into the unit . ( felt defective ) 
cover[-2]##- the cover that came with it did n't fit very well 
flywheel[-2]##- the flywheel you use for most of the navigation was n't in tightly and it was uneven as far as the amount of pressure to make it engage . 
##i was n't sure how long it would take before it would break . 
construction[-2][p]##- this did not feel like quality construction and i was n't sure how long it would last . 
[t] great product great price . 
##i spent much time debating on whether i should go with the zen xtra or the ipod . 
zen xtra[+2]##i decided to save the $ $ and opted for the zen xtra ... and i was not disappointed . 
player[+2],sound quality[+2]##the player is intuitive and outputs great sound quality . 
navigation[+2],sync[+2]##navigation is easy and i found that syncing files from the player to the computer ( and vice versa ) was easy too . 
software[+2]##many have complained about the software included but in my opinion it 's easy to use and effective . 
player[+3]##i love this player and am extremely happy with my decision . 
##i cannot recommend it enough ! ! 
[t] flimsy product . 
##i recently bought the nomad jukebox zen xtra , and did n't even get as far as charging the battery . 
construction[-3]##the construction of the player is the cheesiest i have ever seen -- the front panel refused to clip in correctly , leaving a noticeable gap between the panel and base of the player . 
##this gap allowed the front panel to fly off after barely being touched . 
##i can 't comment on the quality of the audio , because it was back at the store before i ripped a single cd . 
construction[-3]##i 'm not willing to accept shoddy construction on something i paid over 250 dollars for . 
##if the casing of the player is this bad , i can 't image that the hardware is of very good quality . 
##do n't be pulled in by the great price -- you get what you pay for , and there 's a reason this model is so cheap . 
[t] the 3 ( ? ! ) month warranty should be a warning . 
##like many reviewers , i really wanted to like this product . 
price[+1]##the price / performance looked just right . 
##when i bought it late last year , there were enough reviews that i knew the navigation wheel and software would be less than ideal , but it sounded like a fair tradeoff . 
##boy was i wrong . 
##reading the reviews , it looks as though people really love this device for a month or two and then come to hate it . 
##that 's been my experience . 
##if i 'd been paying attention , i would have noticed the 3 month warranty . 
##but i did n't because i 'm used to electronic products having a 12 month warranty . 
##now i know better . 
headphone jack[-2]##i 've had this thing just over a month and the headphone jack has already come loose . 
##a $ 300 device and they skimped on the headphone jack ? 
##so now i 've got to call their customer " service " ( of course , no 800 number ) to send the thing back . 
##from the other reviews i 've read , it sounds like that wo n't be the end of my troubles . 
construction[-3]##i fully expect it to go bad again in the same or some other way in the next 6 months because , as other reviewers have pointed out , the construction is pretty flimsy . 
##now let 's talk about the software . 
installation[-3]##like other reviewers , installation was hell . 
##subsequent behavior even worse . 
software[-2][p]##about 10 % of the time it can 't find the device when i attach it to my pc . 
online help[-2]##after i had it a couple weeks , it got into a state where it could never find the device , no matter how often i rebooted my pc , reset the device , reloaded drivers , etc , etc. creative 's online support was no help at all . 
player[-3][p]##in fact , i 'd have to rate it among the worst i 've ever encountered . 
##finally , i uninstalled and reinstalled the software , the usual measure of last resort for this sort of thing . 
installation[-3][u]##to my amazement , even that process was error-prone . 
things[-3][p]##it took several days of attempts before things finally " worked " again and i have n't a clue why . 
##that does n't leave me with a good feeling about its future stability . 
notmad software[+2]##i did buy the notmad software a week ago and found that a vast improvement . 
##but that 's a moot point now . 
nomad[-3]##my gut tells me the nomad will in the long run be , at best , a 40gb portable hard drive , albeit one on which i can 't create folders , or , at worst , a very expensive lesson in companies never to buy products from again ( i have their audigy sound card and find it in many ways equally frustrating ) . 
##my gut tells me i 'll also end up buying an ipod . 
##which means that in trying to save a few hundred dollars , i 'll end up spending more than twice that . 
##be forewarned . 
##i would have given a 3 to 5 star review in my first few weeks , depending on how mad i felt about the crummy software . 
##now , even 1 star seems like i 'm giving creative the benefit of the doubt . 
[t] very bad company . 
creative product[-3]##i will never buy a creative product again . 
thing[-2]##i purchased a jukebox , it got fried while being recharged , they asked for $ 20usd just to look at it and said that they would charge me for repaing the damned thing . 
##no way , now i have an ipod and i 'm a very happy man . 
##also bought a soundblaster card that they sold for the mac . 
##within months they stopped supporting the new mac os . 
##what kind of a company does that ! 
[t] great value & great sound ; 
##carry your entire collection ! 
##pros : 
sound[+2],power output[+2]##1 ) great sound ( > 98db signal-to-noise ratio beats ipod 's " unspecified " ratio ) and good power output allow the zen xtra to drive large head-phones as well as external speakers . 
volume[+2]##with my sennheiser 497 headphones , the volume is loud enough at 12 ( max is 20 ) . 
player[+2]##the player works well with my sony srs-a 202 powered speakers . 
user interface[+2],navigation[+2]##2 ) the player user interface ( ui ) is intuitive to use , and allows easy navigation of a large or small collection . 
nomad explorer[+2]##3 ) the nomad explorer ( winxp style interface ) works well to transfer files back and forth to use the nomad as an external although the tech support web-site states that the primary intended purpose of the player is as a player . 
nomad explorer[+2]##the nomad explorer provide most of the functionality offered by 3rd party programs like notmad . 
usb 2.0[+2]##4 ) usb 2.0 means fast data transfers ( 1 song / sec ! ). 
battery[+2]##5 ) the cheap , user-replaceable battery ( $ 50 from creative ) is a great advantage over the ipod 's battery which costs $ 100 to replace . 
battery life[+2]##6 ) excellent battery life - 14 hours beats ipod 's . 
look[+2],build[+2]##7 ) chic look and good build - the player comes in a compact form with a metal face plate . 
player[+2][p]##i use it primarily in the provided protective case although i have dropped it about 3 feet from my desk ( by accident ) as well as have played it outdoors in - 30 fahrenheit weather ( by design ) and it has continued to work fine . 
mediasource[+1]##8 ) creative mediasource , although not as sleek looking as windows mediaplayer , is effective in organizing your collection and is linked to a good cddb service ( gracenotes ). 
##a. the cddb downloads information for the cd that you insert such that you do not have to type in the track information such as album , artist , song title , etc. 
id3 tag[+1]##i do n't always care for gracenotes ' genre listings but it allows easy editing of id3 tags . 
cd rip[+2]##b. fast mediasource cd ripping - takes about 40 seconds for a cd on my pentium 4 pc ( 2.4 ghz with 1gb ram ) with 52x drive . 
sync[+3]##c. i do love audio sync which allows a one-click synchronization between the player and the music collection on the computer . 
wake up[+1]##9 ) wake-up feature that allows you to set up the player to wake up and play selected music at a specified time . 
##i have it connected to speakers for a nice musical alarm in the morning . 
play mode[+2]##10 ) multiple play modes - tracks in order of album , shuffle , etc. , is standard on all jukebox players but worth noting that the zen xtra is not deficient in this matter . 
pause[+2]##11 ) minimal pause between songs - less than that on other devices - good achievement for a hard-drive based player 
storage[+2]##12 ) big storage - my entire cd collection in one small device ( 5717 songs , 491 albums and counting ) ! 
##cons : 
plug and play[-1]##1 ) player is not plug and play - need to install nomad explorer first and mediasource to transfer files and i had to be patient as i was used to winxp detecting the player and dragging and dropping the music files into it . 
id3[-1]##2 ) music organization is based on id3 ( by genre , artist , album , etc. ) and this can be a problem for older downloaded music files with missing or incorrect id3 information . 
##this was not a problem for me as most of my collection was ripped from my own cds and i updated the id3 tags on my downloaded music . 
folder[-2]##3 ) folders cannot be created for the audio files . 
##this is unnecessary with id3 tags but people who like to organize their music in folders will not like the zen as the audio files do not allow subfolders but rely on id3 tags . 
##the workaround is to update id3 tags on your files ( through mediasource ) but it can be a hassle if you have many such music files . 
fm[-1],voice recording[-1]##4 ) no fm or voice recording - these would have been nice extras . 
accessory[-1]##5 ) lack of good accessories - this is more of an oversight of creative 's marketing . 
##both creative and third-party powered speakers work great , as do third-party wireless transmitters . 
##a dock is unnecessary as the charger and usb cable do the necessary . 
case[-2]##6 ) the case occludes the display screen when it is closed . 
##i would have liked to be able to see what is playing without having to open the case . 
flip switch[+1]##7 ) some people have problems with the flip switch on the bottom that releases the player cover - has not been an issue for me and is immaterial if you use the case as the case covers the switch . 
##experience : 
##once i got home with it i had to first install creative mediasource and figure out how it transferred files to the player . 
##this required patience as i was used to winxp detecting the player and dragging and dropping the music files into it ( which i could do with my flash player ) . 
##i did already have mediasource installed due to owning the creative audigy 2 soundcard but i did need to re-install it from the supplied cd as the older version did not have the connector to the zen . 
##also , i downloaded the latest firmware upgrade and software updates . 
##recommendations : 
##1 ) buy an extended coverage if offered by the retailer as this device has moving parts and is essentially a portable hard-drive . 
##2 ) buy a good pair of head-phones unless you already own one . 
##3 ) use files with id3 tags - not a problem if your cds were ripped within the last year . 
##4 ) a set of speakers and a wireless transmitter are accessories that will add to your player 's usability ( the latter will allow you to play it on your car radio , home receiver , etc. ) 
##5 ) handle the player with care - it is not meant to be dropped .

[t] headphone jack . 
##i got the 40gb jukebox zen xtra for christmas . 
headphone jack[-2]##so , i 've had it for a month , and the headphone jack went out . 
##i called creative and they said to send it in and they would decide if it in warranty . 
##it 'll take 10-15 business days for them to decide form when they get it . 
creative[-2][p]##nothing but hassle with this company . 
##what kind of product goes out within a month ? 
[t] those who do n't like it are ipod lovers and are in denial . 
##this thing does its job . 
##i 've compared and compared and compared . 
##it was either the 40gb ipod or this one . 
shuffle[+2]##i felt better with this one since it had the shuffle feature and i 'm not too keen on www.ipodsdirtysecret.com. 
##the longest that i have n't charged it was maybe 3 days and that 's turning it off every now and then . 
battery[+2]##replacement battery is $ 50 compared to ipod 's $ 150 . 
##cons : 
cover[-3]##the only thing i do n't like about this is the cover does suck . 
##i dropped it from the couch , landed on carpet and the cover and battery flew out . 
weight[-2][u]##it 's kinda heavy , kinda like having a walkman . 
headphone[-3]##headphones suck , i would invest in some cool ones since it has the eax feature . 
software[-3]##the software sucks . 
##it overrides songs so you have to go in there and put it your own titles especially if you have remixes . 
feature[-2]##also the feature to automatically put in the song information is n't always accurate . 
##you discover this later when you 're listening to a song and it 's the wrong title , causing you to rename everything on your own . 
[t] not what i 'd hoped . 
##i was prepared to love it . 
headphone jack[-2]##i 've had this thing for less than a month , treated it quite well , never dropped it , and the headphone jack is all screwed up . 
##now i have to return it and rip all my music again . 
##good thing i got a replacement plan . 
##wish it included somebody to re-rip all the songs . 
##reading other reviews , i do n't think the replacement one will be any better . 
##i 'm not looking forward to ripping my entire collection every month or two . 
##maybe i 'll get lucky with the next one . 
size[-2][u],weight[-2][u],wheel[-3]##kind of bulky and the wheel is awkward , but i can deal with that . 
software[-3]##software definitely sucks , hangs up my notebook about half the time , but i do n't mind buying notmad . 
player[-3]##i am annoyed that the player 's not automatically recognized as a hard drive . 
##i do n't want to install software and drivers on every computer i 'm ever at . 
##makes me use it much less than i otherwise would . 
##looking at the glowing reviews from people that have had this for a week or two , i kind of wish people would wait until they 've had a product a little while to review it . 
player[-3]##i loved it until it broke , but less than a month is not an acceptible period of time for something to work . 
[t] not durable enough for this road warrior . 
product[+3], sound[+3], use[+2]##i loved this product when i first got it - great sound , easy to use ( even though i agree that the software was n't the best ) and held enough songs to suit any mood . 
durability[-3]##i was willing to live with the larger size ( inconvenient on the road ) but the durability was a big zero . 
hard drive[-3]##always carried it in a case in by briefcase but one day the hard drive just zapped . 
##tech support could n't figure it out and gave up . 
player[-2][u]##i am disappointed and looking elsewhere for something that can withstand the " rigor " of a business traveler . 
[t] the best jukebox mp3 player , hands-down . 
##i bought the 30gb zen xtra from a well-known national electronics store as soon as i saw they were advertising it for $ 219.99 . 
player[+3]##the combination of the price , storage size , and player features makes this player the best on the market . 
##the biggest drawback that people have about the zen xtra is the software . 
software[+3]##fact is , it could n't be easier to use . 
##these models now ship with creative 's mediasource program , which allows you to highlight the files on your computer that you want to add to your zen xtra , click a button , and transfer it straight to your player . 
##assuming you have filled in all the id3 tags on your mp3s , you will not have any problem finding them on your zen xtra . 
sound quality[+3]##sound quality on this is amazing , as with all creative products . 
sound[+3][u]##even leaving it on the default setting ( without the eax enhancements ) produces crystal clear playback . 
menu[+2]##the menu allows you to search for files by artist , genre , and album quite easily . 
battery[+2]##the battery stays charged for a long time , and takes no more than 2 or 3 hours at most to fully recharge via the included ac adapter . 
player[+2]##connect the player to your computer ( via usb ) , open up mediasource , and you can listen to your stored mp3s as they stream directly from the xtra ! 
##get those mp3s off your hard drive , save space , and enjoy your massive music library . 
##awesome feature . 
usb 2.0[+3]##usb 2.0 transfer is insanely fast . 
folder[-2]##minor complaints : 1 ) even though the music is sorted via id3 tag on the player , the option to search for music contained in a folder is unavailable . 
##that is , if a folder on your computer called " mp3 " has slayer ( thrash metal ) , stravinsky ( classical ) , and ice cube ( rap ) in it , you will only be able to play the contents of that folder by searching for the artists or genres manually . 
folder[-2]##the zen xtra will transfer the files to the player , but not the folder name . 
##not a big hassle as many would have you think . 
id3 tag[-2]##2 ) having unfilled id3 tags will cause music to be potentially placed in a folder called " unknown . " 
##i would recommend against using id3v2 tags , and stick with id3v1 only . 
##when the previous versions of the zens were shipped with musicmatch , people had this problem because musicmatch creates both sets of tags , which seem to confuse the zen xtra . 
##take the time to fill in those tags ! 
nomad explorer[-1]##3 ) with mediasource being so easy , i found no use for the bundled nomad explorer software . 
nomad explorer[-1]##in fact , it caused my system to hang more times than not , so i uninstalled it and stuck with mediasource 100 % . 
##so what are you waiting for ? 
##get one now ! 
[t] not worth the trouble . 
##i received this as a gift for christmas . 
player[+2][u]##my first impression was positive . 
##after using it for a few weeks ( the amount of time before the hard drive crashed ) it revealed a few of its shortcommings . 
eax[-2]##first , the sound quality is okay , but ( as at least one other reviewer has mentioned ) the eax can cause audio interference after about 30 minutes . 
##at first i thought it was my headphones but it was not . 
##it was just a problem with the player . 
menue[-3],control[-3]##second , the menu system and controls are poorly designed . 
scroll[-2]##the toggle button that is used to scroll is poorly designed and does not work well . 
button[-2]##the general button placement is not very user friendly . 
##this would not be a great problem if you did n't have so much info to scroll through on a regular basis . 
case[-3]##third , the poor design continues with the case . 
##the flap completely covers the screen because there is no window to see it . 
##it also covers over the power jack when closed . 
##after the first one fatally crashed , the replacement did not work . 
##i bought an ipod and am very happy with it . 
[t] creative nomad zen xtra 40 gb . 
price[+2]##overall , a good buy for the price . 
navigation[+2]##easy enough to navigate through , although i 'd prefer a sturdier button besides the thumbwheel scroll / pushbutton . 
battery life[-3]##my biggest complaint is the battery life or lack there of . 
battery[-2]##there is no way the battery supplied lasts 14 hours ! 
##at best , i 've gotten 3 hours + . 
##i 've tried draining it until it wo n't turn on & recharging it overnight . 
##no difference . 
##if you 're intrested in buying a spare battery it 'll run you another $ 50 , a little steep i thought . 
lock up[-2]##i 've also had the nomad zen lock-up several times . 
##the good news is if you can 't get it to reset / reboot you can still pull the battery and reinstall it . 
##that 's a huge plus by itself compared to the infamous ipod and similar mp3 players where the battery is permanently installed & removing it voids the warranty . 
construction[-2]##the nomad zen could use a little sturdier construction like the archos jukeboxes or some kind of shock resistant case . 
case[-2]##at the very least , a sturdier more protective carrying case would be nice . 
storage[+3],navigation[+2],playlist[+2],battery[+2]##pros : huge storage capacity for the price , easy to navigate , can modify existing playlists on the fly , has a removable battery 
##cons : 
battery life[-2],manual[-2],lock up[-2],replacement battery[-2]##battery life is about 1/4 of that advertised , no operators manual available for any of the nomad zen players ( on or off-line ) , occasional software lockups , replacement battery is expensive 
##note : about 2gb ( 5 % ) of the advertised 40gb of storage capacity is used for the operating software ( firmware ) . 
##this is nothing new , every mp3 player , memory card , etc. , used for digital media today has some kind of preloaded operating software on it . 
[t] a possible discontinued item ? 
##what 's going on creative labs ? 
##is it a coincidence that i no longer can get any of your nomad zen xtras ( worst name ever ) at best buy and now the 60gb nomad xtra is " sold out " or more likely " discontinued " at the almighty amazon.com ? 
##hmmmmm .... 
[t] hard disk mp3 players . 
##if you read reviews for the 4 main contenders in this market - the ipod , creative zen , rio karma and iriver ihp - you 'll notice that each has their pros and cons ; none are perfect and you should decide whether you want to take to take the plunge now or later . 
##if your view in life is that you are going to pay $ x00 to get a device then it must be near ideal - ruggedly constructed , fault proof , good product support , easy to use software - then do yourself a favor and do n't buy yet . 
##all the products have drawbacks and are not mature yet ; if you expect value and reliability then wait a while . 
##if you are ok paying $ x00 for something that can be used now , but is likely to both get better and cost less in the future then try to determine which device is the lesser of evils for you . 
##ipod clearly has the most buzz . 
##great design and looks cool . 
##most people love the appearance and praise the touch sensitive buttons . 
##it has a hold button to deactivate the buttons to avoid accidents ; however , enough reviewers have complained that the hold button is easily broken and then the device can 't be used . 
##some of the more geeky ( non-apple type ) reviewers complain that the scrollwheel is annoying after a while and they resent being forced into this apple-like interface . 
##everyone complains about the non-replaceable battery , yet this is the price of sturdy construction . 
##ipod can be used as an external disk , and apparently stores files without problem . 
##however , the music and data are apparently not separated ; ipod reviewers complain about " white noise " in random feedback mode that comes from appointments / contacts created on the ipod during synchronization . 
##synchronizing music among computers , if you have more than one , seems to be an issue ; research this before buying if you have multiple computers you want to be synchronized . 
##reviews for sound quality are generally ( but not universally ) positive . 
##reviews of apple 's support are generally poor ; they seem to address issues in warranty , which covers a short time after delivery / pickup of item . 
##after that it seems like you 're on your own . 
##ipod has no stop button ; when new users mention this ipod veterans call it " unnecessary " and " so 20th century " . 
construction[-2],support[-2],scroll wheel[-2],headphone jack[-2]##creative zen feedback suffers from construction quality , poor product support , difficulty of using the scroll wheel and reasonably consistent feedback about problems with the headphone jack . 
##construction quality is a difficult item . 
##the zen has a detachable face plate that allows the battery to be replaced . 
build[-2]##what is added in functionality ( battery replacement ) detracts in build quality as the face plate is prone to popping off . 
##drop if just a few inches on a hard surface and the faceplate pops off ( but not if it 's in its case ) . 
##many reviewers say the faceplate simply did n't fit well so they returned the zen . 
support[-3]##feedback on creative 's product support is universally poor ; this is not limited to the zen , it applies to all the company 's products . 
scroll wheel[-2]##the scroll wheel is finicky ; it works most of the time but there is a learning curve for pressing it just right ; new users say they have 50 % - 75 % success rate ; some find it so frustrating that they just return the device . 
software[-3]##the creative software is awkward / difficult to use and just plain does n't load on some computers . 
headphone jack[-2]##enough people have reported that their headphone jack does n't work after a month of using the device to believe that creative has some inbuilt manufacturing or quality control problem . 
folder[-2]##the zen does n't support folders so it is not really a storage device ; even with third party software that " creates " folders , documents and programs can 't be launched from the zen , so it is not a hard disk , it 's a storage device at best . 
sound quality[+2]##reviews for sound quality are generally ( but not universally ) positive . 
##the zen has no stop button . 
##veteran zen users have explained how to stop if that 's what you want . 
##the rio karma feedback suffers from sensitivity in the hard disk . 
##it seems like movement , even small movement , causes skipping in playback and even the device freezing . 
##if you plan to carry the device around ( it is a mobile device , right ? ) then this is something you might want to think about . 
##karma gets consistently good reviews for sound quality and connectivity from its docking device , which has rca output jacks and ethernet jacks for connectivity . 
##usability ( button usage , feature selection , menu structure , display size and quality ) also has good feedback . 
##repair seems to be an issue ; some say the repair do n't exist 
##- you just have to buy a new player . 
##perhaps because of its smaller user base there is also a lack of accessories . 
##like the zen , the karma does not support folders and is not designed to be a data storage device . 
##it only comes in 20gb ; enough for most people , not for those with large collections ripped at high sampling rates . 
##the karma does have a stop button . 
##there are n't many reviews for the iriver ihp . 
##those that have it like it . 
##the only complaint seems to be that the disk rotation is slow , leading to longer delays in some functions ( playback and even a slow display of the menu ? ) . 
##otherwise feedback seems to be good . 
##no comments on reliability , warranty , repairs , accessories . 
##no-one mentions whether there is a stop button , but the photos do n't show one . 
##none of these are perfect . 
##if you have the appetite choose the one that you think has the least deficiencies or is best suited to you . 
##accept that there will be better devices ( or new generations of these ones ) in a year or two that will cost less . 
##if that is for you then pay the money , learn from the experience and you 'll be a more informed buyer when you buy device # 2 . 
##if you are n't into paying $ x00 to learn and experiment , or the cons outweigh the pros , then wait a year or so . 
[t] good for a little while , but .. . 
price[+1][u]##sure , this thing is definitely more cost-effective than an ipod . 
quality[-2]##but with a low price , comes lower quality . 
sound quality[+2],battery life[+2],price[+2]##our special friends at creative gave this thing good sound quality , great features , long battery life , and an unbeatable price . 
player[-3][p]##the catch is it 's built like a piece of crap . 
##it lasted about 1 1/2 weeks . 
headphone jack[-2]##i did n't abuse it , i charged it every day , but the headphone jack just sort of fizzled out . 
##i tried re-setting it , i tried just about every pair of headphones in my house ( 10 pairs ) , and nothing worked . 
##so i contacted customer service at creative , but they said , " if the product seems broken , we cannot help , " or something to that effect . 
##wow . 
##do n't get me wrong , the thing was like heaven for about a week . 
##if you want a quality mp3 player , splurge on an ipod . 
##if you really need to save , buy this thing on amazon , they eventually gave me a full refund . 
##i bought myself an rca mp3-cd player , and i 'm happy with that until a cheap , worthwhile mp3 player coomes out . 
[t] software problem . 
player[+2]##i bought the player this week and i like it by far . 
##this is my fourth mp3 player ( creative nomad jukebox2 and 3 , rio chie , and this one ) , and my third player from creative . 
##here 's something you have to know before you considering about buying this one . 
##pro : 1 . 
battery[+2]##removable and cheap battery - a li battery usually works properly for 1-3 years . 
##my friend has an i-pod for about 2 years and the battery has so so messed up . 
##his i-pod can only play for a couple of hours with a fully recharging now . 
##2 . 
value[+2]##value : comparing data storage with price . 
##3 . 
##size and style : 
appearance[+1]##the appearance is okayed ( at least not ugly ) . 
size[+1]##the size is small ( just a little bit bigger than an i-pod . ) 
##4 . 
use[+1]##easy to use : a lot of reviews has mentioned about this 
##con : 
mediasource[-2]##the software , mediasource , cannot work on my pc . ( laptop , intel p4-2.0 , xp os ) . 
##a tons of reveiws has reported this problem and the same here . 
software[-2]##in fact , each of my creative mp3 players had software problem in the first place . 
##however , the creative lab did come out new update to fix their software problems . 
##i am crossing my finger and wish they will fix the problem . 
##ps : ( mediasource provides similar functions with ms mediaplay such like cd ripping , tagging , music database managing , music file transfering , and more ) 
##now i use ms mediaplayer , musicmatch ( free downladed ) , and " explorer / my computer / grab files from disk c or d into the player " to replace the mediasource . 
size[+1],value[+1],design[+1],software[-2]##in short , this player is good at size , value , hardware design but really bad at its software 
[t] a great player , excellent sound quality , hovewer , has flaws . 
##alright , well i read alot of these reviews , and i read alot of bad and good things about this player . 
##well to say , i had a very bad history with players . 
##one broke , one got stolen , and then i bought the riovolt sp - 350 . 
##if you are planning to buy that player , do not ! 
##that player is a complete piece of sh ***. 
##i returned it once , then i sent it back , and it is crap . 
##now getting back to this . 
##i ordered this player for christmas , and so far i have it for only 2 weeks . 
##now as others said , so far this player is an awesome player , there are flaws . 
##cons : 
##1 . 
display[+3]##the display is awesome , you can see everything you want and read it clearly 
##2 . 
storage[+3]##huge storage space , i loaded my entire collection of music , which isnt that much , 400 songs , and still have 26 gb , out of the 28 provided to you . 
##( 28 not 30 because software itself takes space ) . 
##and those songs mostly are 320 kbps. 
##3 . 
sound[+2]##the sound is awesome , but if u put it too loud , depends on yoursound quality , the sound might crack . 
##4 . 
eax[+2]##with eax on , you can modify your sound , with 4 different presets , which is pretty good , you can get different variations with it . 
##5 . 
software[+1]##if you use software correctly , put in all the id3 tags , you will get an awesome database collection , from which you can easily access your songs . 
##you can also search for your song , which is good . 
##6 . 
software[+3]##i dont know what other people are saying , but the software is awesome . 
##you can easily access ur files , and easily fill in the id3 tags , which can take a while with a big collection of music , but if your not lazy , you will do it without a problem . 
##and i read today that you can also have online fill out the id3 , so its not a problem . 
##7 . 
battery[+2]##battery recharge , is an awesome thing , because it recharges in only like 2-3 hours . 
##8 . 
player[+2]##when you turn on your player , the player turns on really fast , and the music continues to play , as you left it when you were turning it off . 
##9 . 
manage[+2]##you can manage your profile , change the contrast of backlight , make different type of display , either list or tabbed . 
interface[+2]##you can do other different things with it such as choose what kind of " now playing " interface , you can see the interface as modern or classical . 
alarm[+1]##there is an alarm , i still havent used it yet , but it should be good . 
clock[+1]##there is a clock , and date , which can get helpful . 
##10 . 
firmware[+1]##the player has firmware , which will remove the glitches , if there are any . 
##11 . 
music[+3]##the music plays awesome , never skips , even if u run for a bit , so you can listen to music without interruption . 
##cons : 
##1 . 
battery life[-3]##the one and most major thing that i was dissapointed with , in this player , is the battery life . 
##the product manufacturer promised me 14 hours , and what i recieved was 6-8 . 
##5 hours max. i did it like this 
##eax on : 6 hours eax off : 8.5 hours 
##2 . 
panel[-2]##the panel seems like it will come off very easily as other people have said . 
##3 . 
transfer[-1]##you need the software to actually transfer files 
##4 . 
player[-1]##the player has its minor glitches like for example when i turn it on , 60 percent of the time , it sais , shutting down , which means i have to turn off , and turn it on again , which is not to my likings . 
lock up[-2][u]##also , the player sometimes freezes , not a very big problem , but can also be annoying . 
##( but as any hard drive , all of them freeze at certain points ) 
##well thats about it , and as people said in earlier previews that the headfone jack gets messed up , stil havent happened to me , and i hope it doesnt . 
[t] easy to use , massive storage space , sounds great . 
price[+2]##and also , it 's priced very affordably . 
storage[+2]##with 40gb of storage i have about 7,500 songs on the player ( everything music file i have is on there ) with room for about 2,500 more . 
##a similarily priced 15gb ipod would n't have been nearly enough room . 
##having my entire music collection is great when travelling ( both on plane and car trips ) and i do n't have to decide what to bring or copy onto the player -- it 's all there . 
##having to copy / delete files would be time-consuming and is rendered a non-issue with 40gb of storage . 
software[+2]##the software interface supplied was very easy to use but i went ahead and got red chair 's " notmad " software because of some advanced features i wanted . 
sound[+2],earbud[-2]##the sound is great even with the supplied earbuds -- but i find earbuds uncomfortable so i use different headphones . 
##on planes i use a splitter so two headphones can be plugged in for two people and the sound is equally good . 
sound setting[+1]##sound settings can be adjusted for personal preference . 
accessing file[+1]##accessing files by artist and album ( i mostly look things up by artist ) is easy and intuitive . 
battery[+3]##possibly the biggest advantage this player has ( if price was n't enough ) is the fact that the user can replace the battery him / herself by opening the lid and popping in the new battery . 
battery[+3]##since batteries do run out on everything , this will also be a big money-saver since ipods , irivers , rca , dell , all have built-in batteries that need to be replaced by a technician ( apple charges 100 bones for the battery replacement ) . 
value[+2],use[+2]##try before you buy if at all possible : although i am a mac addict now for over a decade and everyone i know has previously bought an ipod , the nomad zen xtra was a far better value and is just as easy to use with regards to both hardware and software interface . 
##i personally am not crazy about the looks of either the ipod or the nomad . 
##the ipod 's white plastic look / surface does n't suit me . 
color[+1]##i like the nomad 's color better , but it 's not terribly flashy . 
##the mini ipod 's look the best to me -- but with only 4gb there 's no way i would ever buy any mp3 player with a measly 4gb of storage . 
##my advice to mp3 buyers : consider how much storage space you will need , then try and listen before you buy -- mp3 players can only fully evaluated by holding and listening to them . 
[t] good for the price . 
player[+2][p]##i have had mine for a month now and have to say i have enjoyed it . 
##the pros : 
price[+2]##price ! 
##almost half what an ipod would cost you ! 
##i do n't care how it looks and i always drive so the size is not important to me . 
sound quality[+2],volume[+2]##sound quality is wonderful , i really like the smart volume sound normalization . 
earphone[-3]##yes the included earphones suck but everyone replaces them anyway . 
interface[+2]##i quickly got to use to the interface and can find any song / playlist etc fast enough . 
playlist[+2]##i also liked the fact that you can save custom playlist you made on the player not just the computer ! 
##cons . 
software[-3]##creative software stinks . 
##it 's horrible . 
##redchair software makes nice software that allows you to do everything you would want to and more ! 
cover[-2]##the front cover can pop off easily but i always have mine in the case so i did n't notice after first day . 
[t] great player . 
player[+3]##have had the player since xmass and love it ! 
##pros : 
sound[+2],battery life[+3],battery[+2],storage[+1],screen[+2], firmware[+1],price[+2]##great sound , very long battery life ( i routinely play it for 12 + hours ) , very fast recharges rate , removable battery , storage size , nice screen , firmware updates , and great price . 
##cons : 
warranty[-2],freeze up[-1],navigation wheel[-2]##short warranty ( 3 months , so i got the extended warranty at best buy ) , occasional freeze up ( easily fixed by popping out battery ) , somewhat flimsy navigation wheel . 
##neutral : 
##i did n't even try the included software . 
##i just bought notmad manager ( $ 25 ) and file transfers are easy drag and drop , songs stored by id3 tags not by folders , needs to have software on computer to transfer files , no window on case ( nice case otherwise . 
[t] i do n't see what everyone 's problem is - i love this player . 
player[+2]##this is an excellent player , especially for the price , with features that are comparable to and even excel the ipod . 
price[+2]##for a price that 's still less than even the lowest level ipod i was able to get this 40gb monster , and the best part is it works as great as it was advertised to and then some . 
##here are the pros and cons ( few there are ) in detail : 
##look / design : 
size[+3],design[+3]##the system is terrific in size and design , imo looking better than the ipods . 
##it 's bigger , but people have grossly exaggerated the size differences - it 's only about half an inch longer and 1/3 inch thicker than the new-generation ipods . 
build[+2]##it 's very solidly built , and has a nice dense feel to it . 
control[+2]##i find all of the controls well-placed and not flimsy in the least . 
scroll wheel[+2]##the scroll wheel is better than the ipod 's as well , in that you do n't risk giving yourself a cramp running your thumb around in circles endlessly - just a small nudge of the finger and you 're there . 
screen[+2]##the screen 's large and easily read . 
pop-up face[-2]##the only beef i can raise in this regard is the pop-off face , that sometimes comes off a bit easily , but besides that it 's perfect . 
sound[+3]##sound : exceptional , though i can 't really compare it to the ipod . 
##from what i 've heard it 's at least equal . 
##like others have mentioned , you can manage to hear new things in songs even though they 're on lower bit levels . 
##there 's no so-called background hiss that i 've noticed , at least so far . 
interface[+2]##interface - practically seamless . 
##songs are recognized automatically by id3 tags , which at first i was against since i had organized my files by folder with a previous player from iriver . 
id3 tag[+2]##yet after ensuring that all the id3 tags are in order ( with the software which is actually not as bad as people make it out ) it actually turns out to be really handy . 
##it 's a dedicated music playing device , anyway , so this serves it better . 
##you can find any song quicky by an artist , album , or genre search . 
playlist[+1]##playlists can be generated on the fly ( which is a bit clunky but still a really nice bonus ) or by using the software , and there are a bevy of eq options . 
balance[-1]##the only thing missing is an option to adjust the balance . 
##software : 
mediasource[+2]##as i mentioned before , the creative mediasource software is actually really robust despite what others have said , though notmad may still work better . 
mediasource[+2][p]##it 's easy to transfer , preview , and organize files . 
id3 tag[+2]##the in-program id3 tag editing is a strong point , as well . 
software[+2]##it was no problem for me to use their software . 
##some may complain that there 's no drag-and-drop capability , but what they should realize is that this is mainly a portable music player , not a computer accessory or hard drive . 
##the software and design are geared towards enhancing the music experience . 
player[+3]##overall , i 'm giving this 5 stars as i 've seen nothing of the problems people have repeatedly cried havoc over , but as i 've only had the player for a while i leave room for doubt if the headphone jack , hissing , or scroll wheel problems show up with me too . 
##so far , however , i 'm a very happy customer . 
equipment[+3]##please consider this much superior piece of equipment before plopping down half a grand for an ipod . 
[t] does not function correctly , unhelpful customer service . 
player[-3]##do n't buy this player . 
##i recently bought this after my archos 20 multimedia self-destructed ( do n't get me started on that piece of junk ! ) and expected it to be flawless . 
player[-2]##unfortunately , after loading 280 + songs , all i get now is " player either not connected or busy . " 
##it will not load any further songs on and customer service has no idea what to do . 
player[-3]##do n't buy this player . 
[t] why can 't it be rated zero stars ? 
product[-3]##do not buy this product -- 
player[-3]##i took perfect care of this player and still it died in the week after the lousy 90 day warranty ended . 
##nearly 4000 songs went up in smoke . 
software[-2]##the software is not good either and the driver has trouble working with other sound blaster products , which is very dumb . 
[t] o man , not cool . 
##ok , im writing yet another review , about a week from my previous one . 
player[+3]##honestly , i love this player . 
##one horrible flaw , or mayybe more than one . 
sound[+3],battery life[-1]##once again , the sound is awesome , the batterly life is only 6-8 hours , and that is because all my music is 320 kbps which does affect the battery life . 
##ok so i donno about what other people said , how the player breaks and stuff , and the headfone jack , fortunately that did not happen to me . 
hard drive[-3]##however , my hard drive did fail , and i have not dropped it once . 
##therefore im saying im returning it right now , and i will see wat happens with my next zen xtra ( same replacement ) . 
##if that one fails too , and i hope if it does , let it happen in the first 90 days , not later , cuz thats the warranty . 
##if it does , ill give up . 
##basically wat happened , is that the hard drive failed . 
##thats it . 
##i cant do anything about it , and i have to send back . 
##the only good thing about this whole process , is that im getting like a 34 dollar amount back , because of the price difference between when i bought it , and now . 
##basically u can see that i have given the player 3 stars , instead of 1 . 
##you know why ? 
break[+3]##because other people that complain about this player are talking bull , this player is awesome , it just breaks fast , which is horrible . 
##now honestly , i love this player , but with all seriousness , i would not recommend it to other people , because of the breakdown flaw. and i honestly would not recomment the people of the ipod , that crap sucks big donkey ..... never mind . 
##i hope my next player doesnt breakdown . . 
##honestly , the best players without any flaws were the goddam cd players . 
##this is all i have to say . 
[t] what a junk . 
player[-3][u]##what a junk . 
freeze[-2]##every time nomad thinks the file is corrupt the os freezes . 
##the only way to recover is to plug the power cord and go into recovery mode . 
##so if you happen to be out of the house and you have a frozen os you can 't use nomad until you get home . 
##after os froze twice on me in the subway i returned the jukebox . 
[t] you will be very disappointed with this product . 
##the reviews of this product can be roughly divided into two groups : ( 1 ) those who have had the product for a few weeks and ( 2 ) those have had the product for a few months . 
##those who have had the nomad for a few weeks are mostly thrilled with it . 
##the price is way below an ipod of the same size . 
##the nomad is only sligtly larger than an ipod . 
sound quality[+2]##the sound quality is very good . 
control[-2],software[-2]##the controls are somewhat harder to use , and there are some oddities about the software tagging system , but most people can live with this . 
##because of the large capacity of the nomad , owners can load hundreds of cds on to it . 
##for most people , they can carry around all or almost all of their music collection . 
storage[+2][u]##having access to so much music where ever you go is terrific . 
##they fall in love with the product . 
##and then it breaks . 
##usually around the time the 90 day warranty expires . 
headphone jack[-2]##typically , the problem is the headphone jack -- it was for me and many others . 
##the nomad is sent back to creative labs . 
##they decide that the owner was responsible for the damage and so even if it is returned within the warranty period , creative will charge you to fix it . 
##in my case , the bill was $ 81 , about a third of what i paid for it . 
##like many others , i had not abused the product , and had tried to take care of it . 
##if my level of care was n't good enough , i had to expect that even if i paid to have it fixed it would break again in a month or two . 
design[-3][p]##i 'm convinced by my own experience and that of many other people who have posted here who have had the same experience that the product is defectively designed , and will not hold up to normal use . 
headphone jack[-2]##the headphone jack seems to be a major problem . 
front cover[-2]##the one other thing i observed while i had the nomad is that the front cover , which is taken off to have access to the battery , seemed to come undone very easily . 
headphone jack[-2]##the headphone jack failure seems to occur just about when the warrranty period is to expire . 
##even if it has n't expired , creative is likely to claim that the owner caused the damage which in turn voids the warranty . 
##and most stores will not take back a product 90 days after purchase . 
##this means that you will have the nomad long enough to load a lot of music on to it , and get used to having it . 
##so when it breaks , as it will , you will find yourself very disappointed and depressed at the loss of the nomad . 
##you will find it very hard or impossible to get you money back . 
##you will have a very expensive paperweight . 
##there are not a lot of good options out there . 
##most people say buy an ipod , but they are pretty expensive and also require you to send the product back to the factory just to replace the battery . 
##my suggestion is to wait to see how the market develops . 
##maybe creative will come out with a better design , although it will be hard for me and its other customers to trust it again . 
##maybe more competitors will bring out similar products . 
##and maybe the answer is to buy an ipod . 
##whatever you do , do n't buy this product . 
##you will be sorry if you do . 
[t] piece of junk . 
##i am a soldier serving in baghdad right now . 
##i bought the nomad when i went home on leave and it worked great for about a month . 
lock up[-2]##the other day when i was listening to a song , it locked up and will not do anything now . 
##it says i have a harddisk problem . 
##and since i 'm out here i can 't mail it back under my 90 days and they wo n't help me out cause they say that the conditions here are not covered under the warranty . 
##it worked good for a while . 
##it did lock up on me a couple of times . 
##and then it just froze and now i 'm out $ 300 for their piece of junk . 
[t] nomads are wonderful , but be carefull ! 
##i first bought a 6 gig nomad jukebox ( original ). 
##unfortunatly it was dropped and damaged a year after i bought it . 
##the batteries would not charge . 
##so i took it back to best buy where i bought it and exchanged it for a newer zen 20 gig model . 
hard drive[-2]##in that model the hard drive just died one morning before my class . 
##it 's nothing major , just a bad hard drive , any hard drive mp3 player can have that problem . 
##so rule of thumb , no matter what you end up buying , get the extended warranty ! 
##it always pays off . 
##hope i 've been of some help . 

[t]the best 4mp compact digital available  
camera[+2]##this camera is perfect for an enthusiastic amateur photographer . 
picture[+3], macro[+3]##the pictures are razor-sharp , even in macro . 
size[+2][u]##it is small enough to fit easily in a coat pocket or purse . 
weight[+1][u]##it is light enough to carry around all day without bother . 
feature[+2][u]##operating its many features is easy and often obvious - i 'm no annie lebovitz , but i was able to figure out most of its abilities just messing around with it at a camera store . 
manual[+2]##the manual does a fine job filling in any blanks that remain . 
auto focus[+2],scene mode[+2]##the auto-focus performs well , but i love having the 12 optional scene modes - they are dummy-proof , and correspond to many situations in which i would actually seek to use the camera . 
rechargable battery[+2]##comes with a 16 mb compact flash and one rechargable battery the charging unit , included , is fast and small . 
##i bought a 256 mb cf and a second battery , so it 's good to go on a long vacation . 
camera[+2]##i enthusiastically recommend this camera . 
[t]perfect to grow into 
##i got my camera three days back , and although i had some experience with digital cameras prior to purchasing this one , i still rate myself as a beginner . 
##i bought this camera because it fit my budget and the pre-production and production model reviews were positive . 
camera[+2][p], use[+1][u], feature[+2]##it 's easy to use , and yet very feature rich . 
auto mode[+1],scene mode[+2]##in the auto mode it functions basically as a point and click , the scene modes are very easy to use and produce good results . 
manual mode[+2]##the manual mode is feature rich and i can 't wait to get the hang of it . 
macro mode[+3],picture[+3]##the macro mode is exceptional , the pictures are very clear and you can take the pictures with the lens unbelievably close the subject . 
battery life[+3]##the battery life is very good , i got about 90 minutes with the lcd turned on all the time , the first time around , and i have been using it with the lcd off every now and then , and have yet needed to recharge it . 
##the camera comes with a lexar 16mb starter card , which stores about 10 images in fine mode at the highest resolution , i intend to buy a bigger card soon . 
[t]near perfection 
##i love photography . 
##i had an older camera that was simply a point and shoot camera . 
##i needed something with more power , so i bought a nikon coolpix 4300 . 
camera[+3], use[+1]##i fell in love with this camera , it combines ease of use , with an immense amount of options and power . 
##you can use the scene modes , or fine tune the options , i. you can change the iso level , shutter speed , etc. 
camera[+2]##this camera is ideal for people who want more power , but do n't want to spend 1000s dollars on a camera . 
[t]not too excited 
##i bought coolpix 4300 two months after i had bought canon powershot s400 . 
##reason for two ? 
##it was not easy sharing one with my teen age kid . 
##the two cameras are very similar in functionality and pricing . 
##i 've had no problem with canon whatsoever . 
picture quality[+1]##with nikon , although picture qualities are as good as any other 4 mp cameras , i 've had the following headaches ; 
transfer[-2]##1 . pictures wo n't transfer to pc directly from the camera using the included transfer cable . 
##i did everything i could , and it took many days of frustration before concluding that the only way to transfer to pc is with the card reader . 
##card reader is included . 
##2 . the speed is noticeably slower than canon , especially so with flashes on . 
##3 . with low battery , it twice wiped out the entire pictures in the memory chip . 
##i used lexar 256 mb and i still use it which means nothing is wrong with lexar . 
##be very careful when the battery is low and make sure to carry extra batteries . 
[t]only " cons " here
##the other reviewers have clearly pointed all the good things about this camera , which i do agree . 
##but there are certain issues might be they are to me here - all of them are minor; not major ones though , 
auto mode[-2]##. this camera keeps on autofocussing in auto mode with a buzzing sound which can 't be stopped . 
##would be really good if they have given an option to stop this autofocussing . 
##. if you want to have the date ; time on the image , its only through their software " nikon view " which reads the images date ; time from the images meta-data . 
##so if you use your card reader ; copy images - you got to onceagain open them through their software to put the date ; time . 
##in that too , there is n't a direct way to add date ; time - you got to say ' print images ' to a different directory in which there is an option to specify the date ; time . 
image[-2]##. even the slightest of the shakes totally distorts your image 
indoor image[-2]##. images taken indoor were n't so clear . 
##you got to have flash ' on ' to get it eventhough your room is well lit 
lens cap[-3]##. lens cap is a really annoying 
##. go ; get a high speed like lexar 12x or higher cf card . 
##else with simpler viking cf cards , it takes couple of seconds to write a picture with approximately " fine **" picture quality  " image size : 1600 . 
movie[-2]##. the movie clips taken will always have some ' noise ' in it - you can 't avoid that . 
camera[+2], picture[+2], close-up shooting[+3]##but overall this is a good camera with a ' really good ' picture clarity ; an exceptional close-up shooting capability . 
##i would rate this is 4.5 stars picture quality ; image size defined above are specific to nikon coolpix . 
[t]bad service 
menu dial knob[-2]##within a year , there are problems with my menu dial knob . 
##it became stucked which makes it almost impossible to switch between modes . 
servicing[-2]##i send my camera to nikon for servicing , took them a whole 6 weeks to diagnose the problem . 
##worse of all , they claim that it 's some kind of internal damage and refuse to cover the cost via warranty ! 
##they would n't repair my camera unless if i pay $ 100 for parts ? and labor ! 
camera[+2],customer service[-2]##it is a good camera in terms of the function and quality , but take your chance with it because nikon absolutely sucks when it comes to customer service . 
[t]system error 
system error[-2]##got a " system error " problem 30 days after purchase . 
camera[-2]##made the camera totally inoperable . 
lens cap[-2]##also , the lens cap design is flawed . 
##you have to manually take the cap off in order to use it . 
audio[-2]##audio on video also lacking . 
picture[+3],delay[+1]##otherwise , it takes very good pictures ; shutter delay is n't so bad either . 
##still , had to send it back to nikon for repair . 
[t]amazing camera 
##i am an amateur photographer and here is a piece of advise to all the folks who are thinking about making a move the digital world . 
camera[+3]##nikon 4300 , i feel , is the best camera out there for the features and price . 
##here were my requirements in a digital camera : 
##1 . i had initially thought of buying a 2 or 3 megapixel camera but these are good for 4x6 " or 5x7 " prints and i wanted some really great 8x10 " photos once in a while . 
##2 . i did not want a very small camera as it seems to get lost in my hands and i was n't comfortable with that . 
##i wanted a decent sized camera with a contour for my fingers to hold it steadily . 
##3 . i wanted a camera that had a lot of built-in settings for different types of suroundings while giving me an option to use my photography skills although , i am an amateur with an interest in photography by turning on the manual settings . 
##4 . and , of course , i wanted a respected brand and had to stay within my budget because i had bought an expensive camcorder before but had n't used it much . 
##depending on all the above requirements , i had narrowed down my search to nikon 4300 and canon powershot s400 models . 
##nikon got the final nod for its settings auto and manual along with movie modes , medium; compact size , price , brand name , good software that is included and previous reviews . 
##i should say i have been very happy with my decision ever since . 
picture[+3]##the pictures are absolutely amazing - the camera captures the minutest of details . 
##a few things that might make it even better : 
indoor picture[-1]##1 . pictures taken in an indoor setting are a little dull and rarely hazy if you tend to take photographs from a distance . 
delay[-2][u]##2 . it takes a while for the camera to actually capture the photograph from the time you click the button and i have seen people becoming a little impatient waiting for the flash to glow . 
picture[-2]##3 . the pictures come out hazy if your hands shake even for a moment during the entire process of taking a picture . 
##all the above , i think , are problems with all the digital cameras out there and so i have no major complaints . 
##try to buy a tripod and that should solve some of those problems . 
##whichever camera you buy , add upto about 200 dollars for an additional memory card i bought a 256 mb card , usb card reader , camera bag and the warranty . 
##and finally , get your pictures developed at a kodak picture maker machine even though it costs you a little extra - no one can beat kodak processing in terms of clarity and brightness . 
##hope this review has helped you in making up your mind . 
##i have taken about 150 photographs so far and have absolutely loved the experience . 
##i am looking forward to my vegas trip for some great photographs now . 
[t]super camera 
##with our compact 35mm broken , and a vacation in europe at hand , i finally decided to enter the digital age . 
##i first intended to buy the 3100 , but am really happy to invest the extra money for the 4300 . 
##the lense is a lot better , and the 4mb produce fantastic pictures . 
auto mode[+2], manual mode[+2], scene mode[+2]##the possibilities with auto , manual , and the very helpful " scene " mode , which offers 11 optimized situational settings like portrait , landscape , beach / snow , sunset etc. , are endless . 
movie mode[+2]##the movie mode is also working great . 
software[+3]##the 4300 comes with excellent easy to install software i use it on xp and win98 without problem , battery charger , usb and video cable . 
##a 64mb flash card camera comes with a 16mb holds 52 pictures on " normal " resolution . 
print[+2]##i experimented with online print ordering with the two major us brick and mortar retailers , and they both delivered great results . 
print[+3]##even at the " normal " setting , a 8x10 print ! shows not a single sign of visible rendering or pixels - you could never tell that the picture has been taken by a " digital " . 
battery life[+1]##the battery life is ok , but can be somewhat short when working a lot with the monitor on . 
##i therefore bought a second battery as a backup , and due to the lightingfast charging with the included charger , which by the way works on 110v as well as 220v in europe , we ran never out of " juice " . 
##i highly recommend the accessory kit , which provides you with everything else you need : 
##a nice camera bag , which holds camera plus all the cables and the charger . 
##furher it contains a card reader , a flash card folder for up to 8 cards , a lense cleaning rag , and an ac adapter , which is very helpful when working in an " outlet environment " . 
camera[+3]##over all a fantastic very compact camera , which made us experience photography on a totally new level ! 
[t]camera shake 
##after reading all the glowing review on this camera , i went to my local camera shop to try one . 
##i currently own an olympus d-550 which takes wonderful outdoor pictures . 
##however , indoor pictures of subjects more than a few feet away can be blurry or grainy . 
##anyway , in the store , i tried coolpix 4300 along with two other 4mp models minolta dimage s414 , and panasonic lumix . 
picture[-2]##focusing on a display rack about 20 feet away in a brightly lit room during day time , pictures produced by this camera were blurry and in a shade of orange . 
##pictures produced by the minolta were orange but not blurry . 
##pictures produced by the panasonic were excellent . 
##the store clerk concluded that the blurriness may be caused by shaking the camera slightly when i press the button , which is understandable since this camera is lighter than the other two models . 
##anyway , i ended up purchasing the lumix . 
##i 'm sure that this camera has all the wonderful features that others talk about . 
##however , as an average person with unsteady hands , i doubt it 'll perform well in lower light settings . 
[t]great camera 
##i purchased the nikon 4300 after several weeks of searching . 
##the value , name , and resolution signed the lease . 
picture[+3]##after nearly 800 pictures i have found that this nikon takes incredible pictures . 
digital zoom[+2],optical zoom[+2]##the digital zoom takes as good of pictures , as the optical zoom does ! 
picture[-2]##the inside pics , can be a bit challenging , but when you can instantly delete pics you dont like , that are not focused perfectly , or need lighting adjustments , make this camera very simple and effective . 
feature[+3]##i love all of the features , and presets as well . 
sunset feature[+3]##sunset feature takes incredible pics in the morning , and the evening ! 
software[+3]##the software you get with this camera is perfect . 
touchup[+2], redeye[+2]##touchups , redeye , and so on are very easy to alter , and correct . 
##i definately recommend a large memory card . 
##i use a 128mb card , and usually get around 70 to 100 pics 1024-1280 res. , with good resolution . 
##very large pics take 8mb each ! 
battery life[+2]##battery life is good , although i recommend two rechargebles , or a alkaline backup , for those emergency pics you have to have . 
camera[+3]##all and all , i am extremely pleased with this camera . 
##making the step from film to digital has been a great move . 
##i find myself emailing pics to everyone i know . 
camera[+3]##great camera , great investment ! 
[t]excellent camera 
##this is my second digital camera , though i also use one at work and have some experience with several nikon and canon models . 
use[+1][u],quality[+2],size[+1]##the nikon coolpix 4300 is wonderful -- easy to use , high quality , and compact in size . 
##with an extra battery and a couple of good sized memory cards you are all set for a day of picture taking while on vacation . 
auto setting[+2]##the auto setting does a great job most of the time but there are manual settings for those who want them . 
##if something were to happen to my nikon coolpix 4300 , i would order another just like it . 
[t]the ricksters review 
##after much research i decided on the nikon coolpix 4300 . 
camera[+2][p]##it has many great features and very few bad ones . 
picture[+2],ease of use[+2]##it takes excellent pics and is very easy to use , if you read the manual . 
##if you cant get great pics from this camera its because you havent read the manual . 
lcd[-1]##the only things i have found that i havent liked is that the lcd is hard to read in daylight but everyone elses is too . 
download[+2]##downloads are a snap and quick . 
control[+2]##controls easy yo use and easy to get to . 
camera[+3]##i 'm extremely glad i bought this camera . 
[t]super little camera 
camera[+3]##really happy with this little camera . 
size[+2][u]##it is n't big and offensive , though you would n't know it by looking at the pics it takes . 
##got it for christmas , still learning a few of the settings , but i do n't take pictures every single day . 
picture[+2],print[+2]##settings for just about everything , beautiful pics and beautiful prints . 
zoomed image[+2]##i expected the 12x digital zoom to be grainy , but onfull size high to fine quality , the zoomed images are quite impressive . 
##did buy a 256mb compact flash , it holds a lot of pics at any resolution . 
##i only wish you could get high quality tiff images at all resolutions , but does n't seem any of the buget cameras do . 
camera[+2]##still , at least from my perspective , a great camera for the money , and i 'm a happy camper ! 
[t]beginner looks experienced with coolpix 
camera[+2]##this is a wonderful camera . 
##my wife and i read and read and read reviews on different cameras for months . 
##in the end this is the one that we decided upon and since have never had buyer 's remorse . 
4mp[+2],optical zoom[+2]##4 mp gives you room for the future gaining experience ; cost offsets over time from wanting more in a camera , 3x optical and the fact that it carries nikon 's quality reputation behind it make the whole package prove itself worthwile at the price . 
picture[+2]##one neat thing - i have taken some pictures in what i thought would be impossible lighting conditions pitch black rooms - no problem for the camera - rooms looked like they had ample lighting . 
[t]can i have a few more stars please 
camera[+3]##this little camera has created a marriage between myself and nikon. never knew i could love a digital camera so much . 
software[+3], online service[+2]##the software that comes with it is amazing and the online service that comes free is really very neat. clean clear and well focused on over 95 % of all photos taken by a beginner . 
##100 % perfect if you put some thought and time into reading the manual before you take the photos . 
##i took the camera and just gave it to someone . 
##no instructions . 
photo[+2]##just point and shoot and the photos were great . 
##just imagine if you place a bit of knowledge when you take your photos . 
memory card[+2]##the memory card fit nicely since i also have a pocket pc and it automatically installed a picture software on my pda wolla . 
##my pda becames a digital album . 
##i have a 128mb card in it and can shoot over 150 hi res photos . 
camera[+2]##if you have to buy a camera on a buget, this has got to be the one . 
##go get it . 
##before they are sold out ! 
[t]great camera 
camera[+2]##great camera , i have been using this for several months and got excellent results , simple friendly usage , in many scenes indoor , outdoor , snow , close up macro etc. 
[t]great camera for a great price 
##i bought my nikon coolpix4300 about a week ago . 
camera[+3], feature[+2]##this is my first digital camera and i can say that i am quite impressed with the features that it has . 
use[+2][u]##it is easy enough to use for a beginner like me but it has plenty of features for me to grow into . 
macro[+2]##i particularly like the way it aids me in taking my macro shots . 
picture quality[+2]##my friends were impressed with the quality of the pictures i took ! 
autofocus[-2]##one downside though is that autofocus does not work well when battery is low . 
##i assume this is the case for most cameras since it does not have enough power to do autofocus . 
battery life[+1]##battery life is ok . 
##i plan on buying a second battery and a larger cf for it . 
[t]not disappointed 
camera[+2]##great camera , and for the price you can 't beat it . 
##i 've been using it for about 3 months now . 
control[+3]##i found the controls very intuitive and learned how to manuver through the menus quickly . 
quality[+3]##the quality is superb . 
size[+2]##the small size is perfect for my little hands , but may perhaps be uncomfortable or awkward for a bigger person . 
[t]field tested 
##we use older versions 880 , 885 of this model in the office and i find them to produce excellent quality photos . 
nikon 4300[+3]##the 4300 is a very durable , compact package , and i find nikon to be a brand that i can trust . 
##it comes with a 16mb flash card that you will need to upgrade ! 
##we got a 256mb card , and have been hard-pressed to fill it over a weekend . 
##the only drawbacks that i have noticed : 
battery[-2]##it comes with a rechargable battery that does not seem to last all that long , especially if you use the flash a lot . 
##so , it 's a good idea to purchase an extra battery to insure that you are not left hanging . 
auto-focus assist light[-1]##it does not have an auto-focus assist light which is nice for taking shots in low-light situations it allows the camera to focus in low light . 
##i would say that this is not a major issue , but it can be slightly annoying if you care about these things . 
optical zoom[-1]##it has a 3x optical zoom , which is average for these cameras . 
##for more , you sacrifice weight and size : more optical zoom requires more glass and focal length . 
##it does have a digital zoom on top of the optical zoom , but you sacrifice quality . 
##i set the camera to the " manual " mode for one main reason : 
##in any other mode it autofocuses continuously and burns batteries . 
##in manual , you can set it to " single af " where it will focus by depressing the shudder button prior to taking the pic ; this is not really a hinderance , you just have to be familiar with its menus and features . 
##in reality , these are the only drawbacks this camera has , much less than many other models ! 
##it is easy to " focus " in on the drawbacks , so do n't think i hate this camera . 
camera[+3]##it really is an awesome camera that is hard to beat for general-to moderate snapping . 
##for work , we use them in the field often , and they hold up really well . 
macro[+2]##they take excellent macro shots as well . 
menu[+2]##the menus and features are easy to manipulate and access , and it takes silent movies . 
[t]it do n't get better 
camera[+2]##i compared this to a lot of other cameras , believe me , it 's value for money . 
picture[+3]##the picturers are amazing . 
##do n't waste time looking at anything else , just buy this one . 
##it do n't get any better then the nikon 4300 . 
[t]excellent compact digital camera 
##i am a nikon fan , and owned and used slr nikon fe , n50 and n90s for many many years . 
picture quality[+2],function[+2]##recently bought this coolpix 4300 along with a 256mb ultra flash card . as expected , i happily found that qualities of the picture are excellent with 3m-4m pixel / fine combos and many of the user-friendly functions are very similar to slr models , and with added convenience of a digital camera that you can see pictures immediately . 
txt file[+2]##i particularly like the " txt " file which records all the control information for all the pictures you take. 
size[+2][u]##the compact digital camera is especially useful if you have little children around and you can always take the camera with you and take many pictures of them . 
##try to buy a high capacity ultra card , as it 's 2x as faster as the regular cf card . 
##consider the time you save during picture taking especially not missing a good moment and during download , it 's well worth the little extra money . 
##an extra rechargeable en-el 1 battery is also handy , so you will seldom run into " out of battery " situation . 
##use the rechargeable because that saves you money and helps the environment in a long run . 
##one thing puzzles me is that for " fine and 2200 + " quality pictures , one ultra 256mb cf card can only hold 130-140 pics , but the size of the pictures are only around 1.2 mb , the math does not add up . 
##i would expecct the card to hold over 200 pictures for size of 1.2 mb/per . 
##anybody can explain that ? 
nikon[+3]##a nikon will make you happier and leave you lots of good memories , as always . 
[t]you will not be sorry 
camera[+3],picture[+2]##i highly recommend this camera to anyone looking for a good digital camera that takes great pictures yet does n't take weeks to figure out how to operate . 
picture quality[+2]##we take this camera with us everywhere and are constantly amazed at the quality of the pictures that we get and the number of different ways the camera allows for pictures to be taken . 
camera[+3]##i am a picture fanatic so i consider myself picky and if your the same way this camera will not let you down.now buy it ! 
[t]absolutely great point and shoot camera 
##first of all , let 's start with my needs : 1 $ 500 budget 2 4mp resolution , 3 optical clarity and color , 4 fast - very little shutter lag and quick sep-up for next picture , 5 compact size , and 6 good camera grip to minimize camera shake . 
##for three months , i 've researched the internet and magazines , queried various sales personnel , and took hands-on in-store test drives . 
##and i finally settled on the nikon coolpix 4300 . 
camera[+3]##i have it for a week now , and this camera has exceeded my expectations . 
picture[+2],indoor shot[+1]##the daylight pictures are brilliant and the indoor shots are very good provided that your subject is no more than about 8 feet away . 
##the shutter lag is on par with what i 've experienced with point and shoot 35mm and aps film cameras and the next frame advance is about a couple seconds using a high speed 12x 128mb compact flash card a salesperson recommended the high speed card since next frame advance speed was important to me - and it was only a few dollars more . 
image download[+2][u]##uploading the images to my windows-based pc is very fast and simple . 
indoor shot[-1]##the only drawbacks i 've encountered are : 1 indoor shots from a distance > 8ft lack contrast and color , but i 've found this to be a problem with all cameras with built-in flashes that i 've used even on a nikon slr . 
##right now , i 'm researching for an inexpensive slave flash unit that 's designed for digital cameras . 
battery life[-1]##2 the battery life seems to be on the short side but adequate for most situations . 
##i got 45 outdoor and 15 indoor shots with the monitor on turning the camera off and on over a 4 hour period before the battery died . 
##an extra for a back-up battery would be a good investment . 
software[-1]##3 the picture editing software it came with is adequate , but not very robust . 
##i 'll still use my photosuite for editing . 
##one more thing about indoor shots - many of the reviews knocked this camera for low light focusing . 
##just for the heck of it , i took it into my dark kitchen with only indirect light coming in though the door , and the focusing was just fine . 
camera[+3]##in summary , i love this camera and would whole-heartedly recommend this to anyone wanting a high quality point and shoot camera in the medium price range . 
##- since i wrote the review above in january 2003 , i still love this camera . 
##i 've picked up a few accessories that i found to be useful . 
##i bought a digi-slave dsf-1s flash unit . 
##i do n't use a bracket , i just hold it above my head and aim the flash with my left hand . 
##i also got a ur-e 4 step down ring adapter , lc-e 900 lens cap , and the nikon 28mm filter set . 
##this provides added protection for the camera lens and allows the use of filters . 
##i leave the adapter and uv filter on all the time . 
##this also allows you to turn on the camera on without having to remove the lens cap . 
##the downside is that you might accidentally take pictures with the lens cap on , the camera wo n't fit in the small cases , and 28mm filters are expensive and hard to find . 
[t]great camera 
camera[+2]##great camera . 
use[+2]##i am impressed with how easy this camera is to use . 
picture[+2]##it takes great pictures . 
manual[+2]##the manual is easy to understand , and it is mostly idiot proof . 
size[+2][u]##it is small , unlike my canon slr , so it easily fits in my pocket . 
##i have not yet figured out how to make it snap quick pictures for action shots . 
##now where did i put that manual ? 
[t]best 4-mp camera of its size and price range 
##do n't let my five star rating fool you . 
##the nikon coolpix 4300 deserves six . 
camera[+3]##i got this camera about a month ago and i can 't put it down . 
##i was considering buying the minolta f-100 and the sony dsc-p 9 , but at the camera shop , realized this one went above and beyond . 
picture quality[+2]##i selected the 4300 right away and have gotten high quality pictures every time . 
autofocus[+1],scene mode[+1],manual mode[+1]##autofocus feels exactly like my film camera while scene and manual mode add a little fun challenge to it all . 
##i would also recommend buying an extra battery and at least a 128 mb compact flash type i memory card . 
##buy this camera and savour it . 
[t]great camera 
##i reviewed several digital cameras before settling on this one . 
##this one was rated very high by several people check out this site and epinions.com . 
camera[+2][p]##i have not been disappointed with my purchase . 
picture quality[+2]##picture quality in outdoor settings is indistinguishable from 35mm . 
indoor shot[-2]##on average , indoor shots with a flash are not quite as good as 35mm . 
##however , the convenience of using digital far outweighs the slightly less accurate indoor pictures . 
camera[+3]##i am extremely satisfied with this camera . 
##i purchased it from amazon on a since discontinued promotion . 
##buy an extra battery - life is good but still somewhat short . 
##do n't buy this camera if you are not going to purchase a 128 megabyte card . 
##you need the storage to hold a decent amount of shots at 4 megapixel resolution . 
##i have one thing to say to the numbskulls who complain that this camera 's controls are confusing and hard to remember : 
##read the directions ! 
##the regular mode in this camera works for 80 % of settings . 
scene mode[+2]##the " scene " mode works well for the remainder of shots that are not going to be in a " regular " setting . 
##i wish the camera had a higher optical zoom so that i could take better wildlife photos . 
optical setting[+1]##however , its 3x optical setting is acceptable for 70 % of the shots that i take . 
##buy this camera , you wo n't regret it . 
[t]digital nirvana 
camera[+2]##if you 're looking for a small , compact , super resolution digital camera , you can end your search with the nikon 4300 ! 
picture quality[+3]##after a lengthy and extensive journey for a feature-loaded , high performance , travel size camera , i initially gravitated to this little gem because of the superior picture quality 4 mega pixel . 
nikon[+3]##after using it for about a month , i can state unequivocably that this nikon definitely delivers a huge bang for the buck . 
use[+1], accessory[+2]##its easy to use and the sheer fun of being able to use an array of nikon accessories like the telephoto and wide-angle lenses is the proverbial icing on the cake . 
picture quality[+3],feature[+3]##yes , the picture quality and features which are too numerous to mention are unmatched for any camera in this price range . 
design[+2],construction[+2],optic[+2]##the design and construction are excellent -- as is the legendary quality of the nikon optics . 
##i own a 35mm slr camera and this is my second digital . 
##if you 're seeking that elusive state of photographic euphoria that is free of buyer 's remorse and filled with cool , then travel to the world of the coolpix 4300 ! 
[t]i love this baby
##had it for a week . 
camera[+2]##there are so many functions in this little , yet powerful camera ! 
[t]it 's so cool 
camera[+3][p]##seriously ! i love it ! 
##my room is so dark and when i tried taking pics of it with my old camera , they came out black , but with this , they look the same in the picture as in real life . 
##better actually cause my carpet looks clean , lol . 
camera[+2]##but this camera is great ! 
picture quality[+3],movie[+1]##the picture quality is amazing and you can connect it to your tv and could make silent movies that way if you wanted to . 
##i can 't connect it to my computer though , but that 's a problem with windows me , not the camera . 
##if you have windows me you should upgrade to xp anyway , lol . 
##but it works perfectly fine on my parent 's computer . 
lense cap[+1]##it does have a lense cap , but it wo n't let you take pics with it on which is real good . 
battery[+2]##the battery recharges ral fast and the recharger thingy that comes with is real nice . 
camera[+2]##ooh , and i dropped it and it still works fine : this little camera has so many features i have n't even gotten to all of them yet . 
[t]excellent little camera 
##i did quite a bit of research before buying this camera , and this one had everything i was looking for . 
use[+1],feature[+2], camera[+2]##it 's easy for beginners to use , but has features that more serious photographers will love , so it 's an excellent camera to grow into . 
weight[+2], picture[+2][u]##it 's light weight enough to take with you everywhere , but powerful enough to get outstanding pix . 
continuous shot mode[+3]##i love the continuous shot mode , which allows you to take up to 16 pix in rapid succession -- great for action shots . 
photo quality[+3],print[+2]##i 'm amazed at the photo quality -- prints are indistinguishable from 35mm prints . 
8mb card[-2]##i only have one complaint , and that is the 8mb card included . 
8mb[-2]##8mb for a camera like this is a joke . 
##a card with more memory is a must . 
##a minor quibble , since most cameras on the market still only include the 8mb cards . 
[t]perfect consumer digital camera 
##if you do any research into digital cameras , you 'll quickly find that this camera is just about the best value out there . 
##these are the reasons i think it 's great : 
feature[+2]##1 it has all the features an amatuer photo-enthusiast would want . 
use[+2]##2 it is easy enough for my grandmother to use . 
size[+2][u],control[+2]##3 it is very compact but the controls are so well designed that they 're still easy to use . 
##4 it has optional lenses like wide angles and extra zooms . 
##5 for " digital film " it uses compact flash cards , which are easy to find , cheap , reliable and supported by many other devices you may have at hoome . 
nikon support[+1]##6 the nikon coolpix line is a well-established line so you know support and parts are going to be available even when nikon releases a newer model . 
picture quality[+2]##7 picture quality is excellent . 
battery life[+2]##8 battery life is excellent . 
optical zoom[+2]##9 3x built-in optical zoom is a lot for this price range . 
price[+2]##10 great price for all the features . 
##here 's what you may miss or be annoyed by with this camera : 
firewire[-1]##1 no direct firewire to the camera . 
##there is usb , though . 
viewfinder[-1]##2 the camera is so small that when you attach some lenses i have the 19mm wide-angle -- wc-e 68 , the optical viewfinder is partially obscured . 
##this does n't affect the picture , of course . 
##you just have to use the lcd viewfinder to see the whole picture . 
##it 's no problem for me personally . 
##3 battery has to be removed to recharge . 
##4 an ac adapter for powering the camera while the battery 's out is not included , although one can be purchased separately . 
##5 two different adapters -- ur-e 4 and ur-e 7 -- are required for some attachment lenses . 
##most of these " annoyances " , though , are comparable to what you 'll find on other cameras in this price range . 
[t]small camera 
##i am new to the whole digital camera thing ; well , new to the whole camera thing period , really . 
price[+2][u],learn[+2],image[+3]##this camera was affordable , very easy to learn , and produces spectacular images . 
auto mode[+2],scene mode[+2],manual mode[+2]##the auto-mode is good enough for most shots but the 4300 also boasts 12 versatile scene modes as well as a manual mode though i admit i have n't played with it too much on manual . 
size[+2]##it 's size also makes it ideal for travel . 
camera[+3]##overall the nikon 4300 is a very dependable , robust , and useful little camera . 
[t]nikon does it again 
camera[+3], print quality[+3]##awesome camera with huge print quality in a tiny package . 
closeup mode[+2], battery[+2]##the same 4mp chip from the 4500 camera , plus a 3x zoom with the ability to expand upon that with extenders , great closeup mode , long lasting rechargable battery , etc etc. 
camera[+3]##in my opinion it 's the best camera for the money if you 're looking for something that 's easy to use , small good for travel , and provides excellent , sharp images . 

[t]excellent phone , excellent service . 
##i am a business user who heavily depend on mobile service . 
phone[+3], work[+2]##there is much which has been said in other reviews about the features of this phone , it is a great phone , mine worked without any problems right out of the box . 
##just double check with customer service to ensure the number provided by amazon is for the city / exchange you wanted . 
at&t customer service[-2]##after several years of torture in the hands of at&t customer service i am delighted to drop them , and look forward to august 2004 when i will convert our other 3 family-phones from at&t to t-mobile ! 
signal quality[+3]##i have had the phone for 1 week , the signal quality has been great in the detroit area ( suburbs ) and in my recent road trip between detroit and northern kentucky ( cincinnati ) i experienced perfect signal and reception along i-75 , far superior to at &#38; t 's which does not work along several long stretches on that same route . 
##i have owned motorola , panasonic and nokia phones over the last 8 years and generally prefer nokia , this phone combines many of the best nokia features , the only feature missing for me is the voice recognition . 
speaker phone[+2],radio[+2],infrared[+2]##my favorite features , although there are many , are the speaker phone , the radio and the infrared . 
speaker phone[+2]##the speaker phone is very functional and i use it in the car , very audible even with freeway noise . 
infrared[+2]##the infrared is a blessing if you have a previous nokia and want to transfer your old phone book to this phone , saved me hours of re-entering my numbers . 
##the combination of the nokia 6610 and t-mobile service ( signal , price , service ) is a winner , i highly recommend it . 
[t]good phone , so-so service . 
sprint[-2]##the day finally arrived when i was sure i 'd leave sprint . 
sprint plan[-2],sprint customer service[-3]##after years with that carrier 's expensive plans and horrible customer service , portability seemed heaven-sent . 
##i 'd always eyed the nokia phones and had heard decent things about t-mobile , so i gave it a whirl . 
size[+1][u], sturdy[+2]##here 's the brief synopsis : the phone is tiny , cute , feels kind of " plastic-like " ( as if it might break ) , but seems pretty sturdy . 
game[+2],pim[+2],radio[+2]##it has lots of little cute features , my favorite being the games and the pim ( personal information manager -- i.e. organizer ) , and the radio ! 
reception[-2]##i spent hours setting up the stations ( accepts about 13-14 , i believe ) , though the reception is unpredictable . 
##also , you need to have the headset plugged in all the time to have the radio work and that can get tedious . 
sound volume[+1], ear[-2]##the headset that comes with the phone has good sound volume but it hurts the ears like you cannot imagine ! 
ringtone[+1],background[+1],screensaver[+1],memory[-2]##the phone comes with okay ringtones , some decent backgrounds / screensavers , but the phone has very little memory ( mine had 230kb as it arrived from amazon , so you do n't have too many options on what you can put on there ) . 
color[-2]##the colors on the screen are not as crisp as i 'd have liked them to be . 
##however , it serves its purpose . 
backlight[-1]##the backlight on the phone goes off way too quickly ( dangerous when you 're driving at night ) , and there 's no way to change this -- 
##i checked with nokia . 
button[-1]##the buttons on the phone are small , even for my small fingertips , but you get used to them rather quickly . 
menu options[-1]##the menu options are uncreative , as you can 't see a full screen of menu items to pick from ; you have to scroll up and down to find what you 're looking for ( yes , this is minor , but not when you 're trying to keep your eye on the road ! ) . 
##more downside to this phone ? 
volume[-2]##the volume . 
##oh my goodness -- 
volume[-2]##i have excellent hearing but the volume level on this phone is especially quiet . 
##forget talking on it in public -- you just can 't hear the other person ! 
battery life[+3]##on the up-side , the phone has amazing battery life . 
phone[+2]##i do like this phone overall ( would give it a 3.5 ) , but unforutnately , i am returning it . 
##i was surprised by t-mobile 's service . 
t-mobile reception[-3]##i assumed they had exceptional service , but their reception in my area ( los angeles ) is horrendous . 
##reason ? 
##they piggy-back on cingular 's service . 
t-zone[-3]##also , their t-zones , although cheap ( $ 4.99 / mo. ) never works . 
customer service[-2]##since i received the phone , i spent countless hours on the phone with customer service reps who promised t-zones would work " in 24 hours " . 
t-zone[-2]##i must have heard this about a dozen times over the span of 2 weeks , when t-zones never worked . 
##24 hours ? 
##by what time standards -- martian ? 
t-mobile[-2]##apparently , t-mobile is heavily back-logged and can 't keep up with demands . 
##also , they 'd forgotten to add " wap " capability to my service ( duh ) , so that took another 4-5 days of figuring out . 
customer rep[+2]##in all fairness , customer reps are very nice , and they ( most of them ) try hard to answer your questions . 
##but they do have this annoying habit of asking you if they 've answered all your questions , even if they did n't , to which they always seem to expect a " yes " answer from you . 
##i realize this is for quality assurance purposes , but i should have the right to say when my questions have not been answered ( i.e. me : 
##" when will my t-zones work ? " , csr : 
##" i 'm not sure " . ) . 
##umm , well , thanks for nothing . 
##this one csr insisted on trying to get me to say that he 'd answered all my questions ( same interaction as i just described ) , and well .. . 
##that was annoying . 
csr[+1]##t-mobile is trying very hard , and again -- they do have pretty good csr 's . 
call[-2]##however , the calls constantly drop in my area and i experince mega-static , to the point where i 'd have to dial numbers 6-7 times to get a clear line . 
##and no t-zones . 
##so what 's the point ? 
sprint[+1]##i 'm staying with sprint , and though i fear that their csr is n't nearly as good as t-mobile 's , the clarity of their reception is exceptional . 
##i 've bought the very expensive sanyo 5500/vm4500 -- which i love -- and i 'm okay with my services . 
##guess all that glitters is not gold . 
##it was worth a shot -- too bad it did n't work out . 
##hope someone else has better luck ! 
[t]the phone refused to die . 
##i bought one of these phones in kuwait to use with the mtc prepaid telephone service ez because i would be able to use it when i return to the states with t-mobile . 
##recently i accidently washed my telephone with my laundry through two complete 18 minute wash cycles of a washing machine . 
##disgusted with myself after i found the phone in the bottom of the washing machine , i was about to throw it away when one of my fellow soldiers asked if he could dry it out for me in an effort to revive the phone . 
##two days later the phone was returned to me in complete working order . 
phone performance[+3]##while i like the performance of the phone in every regard , i would buy another one solely upon the apparent indestructibility of it . 
nokia[+3]##i highly recommend a nokia 6610 . 
[t]best phone for free . 
##i 've had an assortment of cell phones over the years ( motorola , sony ericsson , nokia etc. ) and in my opinion , nokia has the best menus and promps hands down . 
feature[+2]##no other color phone has the combination of features that the 6610 offers . 
speakerphone[+2]##from the speakerphone that can be used up to 15 feet away with clarity , to the downloadable poly-graphic megatones that adds a personal touch to this nifty phone . 
radio[+2]##whether you 're taking a brisk jog , waiting for a bus or just having lunch at the park , you 'll be glad you had the fm radio . 
##wish it were a flip phone , but thats not a deal breaker ! 
[t]glad to own . 
##i have had this phone for about 5 months . 
battery[+2]##i treat the battery well and it has lasted . 
##at my heaviest usage , i must recharge after 3 days . 
##it lasts about 5 days otherwise and has lasted up to 10 when i was making very few calls . 
##signal strength will affect the battery life . 
##frequent signal searches eat up battery power . 
##i took great care of the screen , till i realized that the part that might get scratched is part of the cover . 
##i can replace that if the scratch is unbearable to look at . 
volume[-2]##the volume level of the phone is not all that good . 
ring[-1]##some of the higher pitched rings are very easy to hear , but not easy to listen to . 
tone[-2]##the more subtle tones that were included with the phone are hard to hear at times . 
vibration[-1]##the vibration is not top . 
##it is a teeny phone , so it is hard to put a big mechanism in . 
##i do n't use the vibration , because it is often easier to hear it vibrate then to feel it . 
##vibration was not even listed as a feature when i purchased this . 
##so it was no loss . 
phone[+2]##overall this has been my favorite phone that i have owned . 
battery life[+2],size[+2],volume[-1][u]##great battery life , perfect size , but a tid bit quieter than i would like . 
##i do hope that they offer more faceplate options . 
look[-1][u]##i am bored with the silver look . 
[t]cool . 
color screen[+2]##it has a nice color screen . 
size[+1][u]##it is small . 
radio[+2], radio[-1]##radio is awsome , but it does n't work unless you have the earpice in . 
##that is a major minus , but its not that bad . 
t-mobile[+2]##t-mobile was a pretty good server . 
##it has 2 games . 
game[-2][p]##they are not wowable good . 
##you have to buy better ones . 
voice dialing[-2]##it also does n't have voice activated dialing . big minus ! ! 
***[t]great phone , but no warranty ! 
phone[+2],warranty[-2]##this is a very nice phone , but there is no warranty on it . 
##nokia will not cover phones bought from amazon . 
phone[-2]##we got two phones for the t-mobile family plan ( indeed very easy to switch to the family plan ) and one came with a broken headphone ( can hear but cannot be heard ) and one died today after less than two weeks of use . 
##i 'll see how much help i can get from amazon and report back . 
[t]menu flaws ? mine could n't send text messages . 
##i upgraded to a 6610 at my local t-mobile store . 
message[-2]##when i got it home , i discovered that the menu options for sending messages via either text or email simply were n't there : 
##it defaulted to unchangeable email . 
##so i spent half an hour on the phone with tech support , only to have the online tech person pull one off the shelf and tell me he had the same problem . 
##i returned to the store , whereupon the clerk insisted that he could make it work ; he could n't . 
##he spent another half hour on the phone with tech support , to no avail . 
##so i had to give up and return it , having lost about 4 hours . 
sound quality[+2], fm[+1], earpiece[+1]##while i had the phone , the positive features were : good sound quality and an excellent fm phone and earpiece . 
size[-2][u], operate[-2][u], button[-2]##negative : impossibly tiny and difficult to operate , barely visible , power button . 
key[-2]##poor visibility on the keys . 
##you have to tilt the phone around to catch the light on them . 
[t]great speakerphone and great reception ! ! reccomend ! 
##the title says it all ... 
speakerphone[+3], reception[+2]##the two biggest things is the excellent working speakerphone " unlike the nokia 3650 " and the superb reception nokia is known for in the gsm phones they make ... 
camera[-1]##only con i can think of is no camera ... . 
##no big deal for the size . . 
phone[+2]##this phone is a winner ... 
[t]perfect . 
phone[+3]##anything this phone does , it does perfectly . 
speakerphone[+3],radio[+3]##the speakerphone , the radio , all features work perfectly . 
##the speakerphone : 
speakerphone[+3]##this phone has a very cool and useful feature -- the speakerphone . 
speakerphone[+3][p]##as said before this works perfectly . 
volume[+1]##you can adjust the volume to be heard anywhere or so that it does n't make that big of a disturbance . 
speakerphone[+1][u]##the person on the other end of the call can hear you perfectly . 
speakerphone[+3][u]##you can be up to about 3 feet away from it and it will still work perfectly . 
speakerphone[-1]##only one complaint about the speakerphone , you can only activate the speakerphone feature once the person you are calling answers the phone , not while it is ringing . 
##the radio : 
radio[+2]##this phone is one of the few phones that have an fm radio tuner built in . 
radio[+2]##this radio receives fairly decent reception but not nearly as good as a normal radio , but as long as the stations are coming in clearly the phone 's radio should work perfectly . 
##tri-band : 
feature##one highly beneficial feature of this phone ( at least to me ) is that it can be used anywhere in the world except a few countries that do not use gsm , a few in asia . 
phone[+2]##i bought this phone for my trip to south africa and it worked almost perfectly . 
t-mobile[-1]##the only problem i had was a small glitch with t-mobile . 
reception[+3]##anywhere i went in south africa this phone received full bar reception . 
##if it worked like that in south africa , i imagine it would just work without a hitch in europe . 
##sold in other parts of the world : 
phone[+2]##another benefit of this phone is that it is truly an international phone ; the 6610 is sold in almost everywhere in the world . 
phone[+2]##this means that there is a good chance that this phone will not break easily like typical american phones . 
##or on the rare occasion it does you can bring it into any t-mobile store , which are located in many countries in europe . 
##i cannot stress enough how big of a benefit it is to have a european phone and a european company providing your cell phone service . 
##able to use service in another country : 
##if you decide to go to another country for an extended period of time , you can just buy a sim card from a service provider in that country . 
##you would then have a phone number in that country and not have to pay for international roaming in that country . 
##size and weight : 
size[+2],weight[+2]##when you put this phone in your pocket you forget it is there ; it is unbelievably small and oh , so light . 
size[+2]##this is a benefit for many reasons ; one being just for appearance , your pants wo n't be bulging with this phone in your pocket . 
##battery life : 
battery life[+3]##the battery life on this phone is surreal . 
##it lasts , truly , 7 days on standby . 
battery[+2]##i 've used the speakerphone for almost two hours once and the battery did not even go down one single bar . 
battery[+2]##it is amazing that the battery lasts so long when the phone is so small and light . 
phone[+2]##this phone has many other features , ir , ; just to name one , the features above i view as the most beneficial . 
bluetooth[-1],high speed internet[-1]##the phone has a few minor inconveniences , but only because it lacks those features , bluetooth and high spend internet , but there are very few problems with things that you expected this phone to do . 
phone[+3]##overall , i highly recommend this phone . 
phone[+3]##it is a perfect phone in such a small and appealing package . 
[t]so far i am more than pleased . 
##i love the pros and cons reviews so here ya go : 
##pros : 
size[+3]##size - extremely small and convenient will fit in your pocket and not bother you . 
ringing tone[+3],radio[+2]##sound - excellent polyphonic ringing tones are very nice ( check cons ) it also doubles as a radio , which is a nice feature when you are bored . 
speakerphone[+2]##speakerphone - loud and clear has some nice extra features like currency converter and a stopwatch . 
web[+2]##surfing the web on it is nice as well , i just wish there were more wap pages available . 
##cons : 
ring tone[-2]##ring tones only come with crazy songs and annoying rings , there is only one ring that sounds close to a regular ring . 
screen[-2]##the screen is easily scratched but if you have the warranty you should be able to swap it out . 
game[-2]##games kind of stink and you cant download them you have to get the link cable to get additional games . 
[t]great buy . 
phone[+2],size[+2]##nice little phone ... light compact . . 
##great features . . 
button[-2]##buttons do seem a little sticky tho .. and the hands free kits ' connector might be a problem .. 
[t]it works ... as a phone ! 
##perhaps there is a tone of irony in the title of my review , but i actually mean it in earnest . 
##after having had my heart broken by a sexy piece of hardware that simply would n't perform . 
##i replaced it with this not-quite-so-dazzling , but definitely more functional device . 
wireless telephone[+2]##although the nokia 6610 is a little short on the features department , it is an outstanding piece of hardware for doing what it was primarily meant to do : to be a wireless telephone . 
reception[+3],sound quality[+3]##the reception and sound quality are top-notch . 
##i can routinely talk on the phone in my house in the suburbs , which is an unaccustomed luxury , even with t-mobile service . 
size[+2],weight[+2]##i like the size and weight of this little critter . 
size[+2][u]##i am able to carry it close to my body , in places where other phones are not so easily concealed . 
layout[-1]##the keys are close together , and the layout is a bit funky in relation to standard rectangular layout keypads , but it 's not too weird . 
key[-1]##the fact that the " 0 " key is the space key for text input is a bit confusing , as many phones use the " # " key instead . 
##but that 's not an insurmoutable obstacle . 
screen[+2]##the screen is bright , easy to see in the daylight , with nice colors . 
picture[+2]##it receives very nice mms pictures from other gsm phones . 
user interface[-1]##there are some features in the user interface that i find a little inconvenient . 
menu option[-1]##the menu options appear one at a time , taking up the whole screen , and one has to scroll down one by one , or have memorized where they are in the menu order , to select them by using the number keypad . 
##thumbs down on that one . 
vibrate setting[-2]##the vibrate setting is loud ! 
vibrate setting[-2][p]##so loud , really , that it does n't work terribly well as a silent ringer option . 
ringer[+1]##but , then again , the ringer can be so loud that i heard it ringing inside my office , when i was already out on the street .. . 
##which was a good thing , because i realized i had forgotten my phone ... 
voice dialing[-1],headset jack[-1]##other things that i miss are voice-activated dialing and a standard 2.5 mm headset jack . 
##i 'd like a camera phone , but i 'd rather have a phone than a toy that takes pictures but makes no calls ... 
##pros : 
weight[+1], design[+1]##- light , compact design 
construction[+2]##- solid , high-quality construction 
keypad[+1]##- well-backlit keypad 
reception[+3]##- outstanding signal reception 
sound quality[+2]##- excellent sound quality 
screen[+1]##- bright , visible screen 
speakerphone[+1]##- speakerphone 
battery life[+2]##- very long-lasting battery life 
##cons : 
user interface[-1]##- some features in the user interface 
voice dialing[-1]##- no voice activated dialing ( what were they thinking 
picture[-1], ringtone[-1]##- no option for caller-id pictures or individualized ringtones . 
headset jack[-1]##- no propietary headset jack

phone[+3]##one of the best cell phones i have ever used to-date . 
speakerphone[+2]##i like the speakphone function a lot . 
##it allows me to place the phone on the table while talking and working on my computer or other jobs . 
quality[+3],durability[+3]##i am very pleased with its quality and durability . 
key lock[+2]##i like the automatic key lock function . 
weight[+2]##the phone is very light weight . 
screen[+1], ring tone[+1]##the screen is bright and ring tones are unlimited . 
fm radio[+2]##the fm radio is cool . 
##most of our emplyees use this model phone . 
##best regards sadoun satellite sales 
[t]best of the best mobile phone . 
nokia[+3]##while going for a cellphone , i was fully determined to buy a nokia only as it is the best in cellphones . 
##after much survey of all the present handsets and recommendations from friends , i bought this nokia 6610 . 
phone[+3]##and really this is the best phone one could have . 
feature[+2]##it has all the features one would need in a cellphone . 
weight[+1],phone[+2]##it is lightweight , sleek and attractive . 
phone[+2], menu[+2]##this phone is very user-friendly , easy to manipulate &#38; very convenient to scroll in menu etc . 
##the time taken in shifting from one menu option to other is in microseconds only . 
radio[+1]##it has fm radio option and i can listen to music anytime . 
speakerphone[+2]##its speakerphone option allows us to do long talks conveniently , lying on bed &#38; phone lying by your pillowside . 
wallpaper[+1],tune[+2]##it comes equipped with lot of wallpapers and polyphonic sweet tunes . 
camera[-1]##only if we could get one camera in it . . 
##it did have scored over all other competitors .... 
phone[+2]##i am enjoying my phone a lot .... 
[t]cool phone ! 
##like some other reviewers , i recieved this phone using t-mobiles upgrade program . 
##i had been comparing the 3650 , 3560 and the 3595 but could n't settle ... then along came the 6610 , which was perfect for me . 
##pros : 
size[+1]##small size . 
size[+2][u]##i love the fact i can carry it in my shirt or pants pocket and forget about it . 
##just make sure the keys are locked . 
color screen[+2]##color screen is good . 
calendar[+1]##it has lots of features such as the calendar which works like my outlook calendar . 
key[+1]##the keys are laid out normal so there is no guessing . 
menu[+3]##navigating through the menus is super easy , especially if you have owned a previous model nokia phone . 
battery life[+3]##battery life is very good , i use it every day and i have to charge it every 5 or 6 days or so . 
##cons : 
##not many . 
volume key[-2]##the volume key can be hard to press , but i think this may be by design rather than a flaw , perhaps to keep you from pressing it accidentally when you are in a call . 
pc cable[-2]##pc cable is too expensive ... $ 50 for a usb cable ? 
##please ! 
##is this how nokia subsidizes their free pc software ? 
[t]slightly better than average phone in its class . 
##first of all i have been a big nokia fan and have been upgrading my cell phones about once a year ( right after the release contract is over ) . 
##my last phone was a samsung s105 which imo is superior and cheaper to this phone . 
##below is how i evaulate this phone with other t-mobile phones which i have borrowed from parents / friends : 
##sound quality : 
##the most important thing for me is sound quality . 
sound quality[+2]##nokias have always had good sound quality and this is no exception . 
##i think the sound quality of this phone is slightly better than my samsung phone , the motorolla t720 series , and the sony ericsson t610 series . 
loud phone[+2]##the loud speaker function on the 6610 is great because you do n't need to put your phone right next to your ear to talk . 
##overall design : 
size[+2][u]##i like my phones to be small so i can fit it in my pockets . 
##of all these phones the motorolla and the sony ericsson phones are the smallest . 
##the 6610 is the actually the longest but they are all very small . 
##as much as i like nokia phones the flip phones imo are much better because a ) you wont scratch your screens / keys b ) you dont need to lock your phone all the time to prevent accidently hitting the keys . 
##ease of use : 
##how easy is it for me to get to a certain menu ? 
##the samsung phones has a customize function so that you can assign certain functions to directional buttons ( like assign alarm clock to the left directional key ) . 
##that is a very nice feature . 
##the 6610 is still easier to use than the other two phones ( t610 , t720i ) . 
##the sony ericsson phone ( t610 ) has the most whistles and bells , but is also the hardest to use . 
##battery : 
##the nokia , samsung and the sony phones can all last for 3 days provided you do n't talk too much . 
##the motorolla phone have a horrible battery which lasts about a day ( although i heard that the motorolla t722i has a much longer battery life ) . 
##features : 
##the t610 has the most functionality hands down . 
##personally i found the integrated digital camera of the t610 to be very nice . 
##my girlfriend is paranoid when i am not around her and i just take a pic and send it to her on the spot so she can regain her sanity . 
##the t610 can also compose music , a feature which most wo n't use . 
radio[-2]##the 6610 has the radio function which is utterly useless . 
application[-2]##it also has a stock tracking app built in ( also useless ) and a somewhat useful application which converts all types of metrics ( currency , length , area , etc ) . 
##the s105 ( samsung ) has a beautiful big display ( 65,000 colors ) , and i can 't say much about the motorolla . 
##all these phones have color screens , polymorphic tones , and are internet ready . 
##in music tones department the 6610 has 20 chords ( thats number of different instruments which it can play ) i think , the samsung i think have 15 , i donno about the other phones but i feel the t610 has the best sounding ring tones . 
software[-1]##regarding pc software support nokia suite does not work with some versions of xp as i tried to connect my phone via infrared port on my laptop . 
##i called nokia tech support and they blamed microsoft . 
##oh well .. 
phone[+1]##overall this is a slightly better than average phone . 
##both the samsung and the sony phones offer a lot more features than this 6610 . 
##personally i like the samsung phones better because i found myself liking the flip phones so much more . 
##i think there is a good chance i will try to get a samsung flip camera phone next year . 
##if t-mobile does not offer such a phone most likely i will get the t610 . 
##they are all free if you get a new account anyway , but stick to t-mobile if you are going to use your phone overseas because t-mobile actually allows you to unlock your simm cards so that you can buy simm cards cheap from other nations and plug into your phone when you are doing some international travelling . 
[t]perfect phone . 
phone[+3]##this is the best phone i have seen . 
[t]i bought 2 . 
##i bought 2 of these phones 2 months ago for myself and my girlfriend . 
##we got a familyplan from t-mobile which saves us tons . 
phone[+3]##the phones are awesome . 
battery life[+2][u],reception[+2], application[+2]##we hardly ever have to charge them , get great reception ( live in chicago ) , and the customization and applications are awesome . 
##here 's a hint : go to nokia.com and get their pc suite and a connection cable if you dont have irda or bluetooth . 
pc suite[+2]##you can do * so * much more with the pc suite , i.e. free ringtones from midi files , free graphics from any picture on your computer , and if you know how to program jme you can even make your own apps / games . 
sound quality[+2]##the phone 's sound quality is great ( turn up the volume if its too quiet , people , this thing will get loud ) i dont have any complaints about this phone and the only thing that i miss from my 8290 is voice dialing . 
[t]nokia 6610 great for games and ringtones . 
phone[+3]##i bought this slick phone and i am very happy with it . 
size[+1][u],game[+1],ringtone[+1]##nice and small and excellent when it comes to downloading games , graphics and ringtones from www.crazycellphone.com 
[t]nokia 6610 . 
phone[+3]##i just purchased this phone and i think this is the coolest phone i ever had . 
radio[+3]##the features are really cool like the radio . 
radio[+3]##the first night i got this phone i put it next to me when i went to bed just to listen to my favorite music station and the handset itself doesnt weight anything its too light and feel so comfy with it . 
speaker[+2]##technology wise , i think this is awesome plus the speaker makes it even great ! ! ! ! i love this phone ! ! ! 
##why i do n't can this product without a plan ? 
##i 'm live in brazil and i need very to buy this product without a plan to use in here in other operators . 
##i 'm pay in auto-debit in my account . 
##please , if anyone want sell to me this cell phone in my conditions , i 'm wait very happy . 
##thanks ! 
[t]excellent , but only gsm ? 
phone[+2],gsm[-1]##i thought this was the ultimate phone when it comes to basic features , but i was dissapointed when i saw that it was only a gsm comaptible phone . 
##as i travel quite a lot , i 'd want something with gsm as well as cdma tri-band . 
phone[+2]##for a specific location , i still think its a great phone . 
[t]i really think . 
##i think that it is a were good mobile phone and i may buy it . 
[t]great phone , but what did you say ? 
phone[+2],screen[+2],ergonomics[+2],size[+1][u]##this really is a great little phone ; its got nice features , a beatiful screen , great ergonomics , and its tiny ! 
##i waited a few years between phones , mostly because ( like most i think ) i didnt really need one . 
size[+2]##this phone won me over , and a big seller was the size ; it fits nicely into any pocket without falling out . 
##the downside though , may be a big one for you . 
volume[-2][u]##its quiet . 
##really quiet . 
##grandma in church quiet . 
##i 've gotten used to it ( holding it in just the right realation to the ear , ducking into quieter places in bars ) but when others borrow it they 're shocked i can use it . 
##so , i recomend it , but not for those that have any hearing troubles , or for those that like to talk a lot in crowded public places ( which is annoying , by the way . ) 
[t]incredibly pleased . 
##i bought this phone when it first came out in the summer . 
##prior to my switch to t-mobile , sprint was my service provider . 
##to say the least , i was horribly dissatisified with my service with sprint , which was why t-mobile was so fantastically refreshing . 
##my past two phones were all flip phones , and i was beginning to tire of them . 
nokia[+2]##nokia was my first nonflip phone , and i 'm glad i decided to go with them . 
volume[+2][u]##first of all , my calls were loud and clear , unlike with sprint . 
reception[+2][u]##i could make phone calls from locations i previously could not ( like my apartment ) . 
size[+1][u],weight[+1],design[+3]##the phone is small , light , and very attractive . 
battery life[+3]##the battery life is amazing . 
color screen[+1],ringtone[+1]##the color screen is a plus , as are the polyphonic ringtones . 
phone[+2]##i 'm not one who uses web browsing , so this phone easily met and surpassed my needs . 
phone[+3][p]##i highly recommend this phone to anyone . 
##i 've yet to be dissappointed . 
[t]
##nokia 6610 ( sound quality ) the phone is great with very cool features &#38; options , but comparing to my older motorola phone , it gets a failing grade in speaker quality . 
sound[-2],volume[-2]##i do here a constant high-pitched distorted sound , not to mention the volume does not seem to be loud enough . 
##it 's going back today , &#38; being replaced with the new samsung x105 . 
##you do take your chances with this phone . 
[t]ultimate phone for mobile life . 
##i considered this phone ( nokia 6610 ) , mainly because of my sister and the features . 
phone[+2], feature[+2]##it is a great phone , if you are traveling all over the world , packed with wonderful features . 
##truly , i am quite impressed . . ! ! 
weight[+2][u],battery life[+2]##this is a very light phone - a little less than 3 oz , with long battery life ( not as long as the new polymer technology ) . 
##on an average , you would charge it once a week . 
speakerphone[+2]##the hands-free speakerphone is quite powerful ( like the motorola phone , i used to own ) . 
speakerphone[+2][p]##i simply love this feature . 
headset[+3]##in addition it comes with a sleek and powerful headset . 
radio[+2]##the built in fm radio is excellent for people traveling by public transport . 
##if you buy the stereo headset , you will enjoy it much more . 
pc sync[+2]##the pc sync feature is superb that comes with nokia pc suite software ( with data cable or infrared port or bluetooth ) . 
##no more hazzles of keying in all data , using the small phone keypad . 
##just maintain them ( phonebook , calendar and to-do list ) in ms outlook or lotus notes and transfer data back and forth . 
tone[+1],wallpaper[+1],application[+1]##additionally , it has more fun stuff like more tones , wallpapers , screensaver , stop clock , alarm , java applications ( chess , currency converter etc. ) 
message[+1],picture sharing[+1]##the mobile text messaging , chat , picture sharing etc. other nicities , that you would enjoy . 
mms[+2]##the mms technology is very well integrated with this phone , which you will enjoy . 
##the built-in camera they offer these days is more of kids stuff . 
##if you have a good digital camera , there is no reason to consider the camera capabilities of a mobile phone . 
##however , if you are keen , you can attach a camera to this phone . 
##i have not yet discovered the internet features yet , which i will be doing soon . 
##i felt that i should write this comment asap , as i am quite excited in using its features . 
phone[+2]##i can recommend this phone to anyone , anytime . 
[t]awesome phone choice . 
##after using the bulky 3650 for three weeks , i searched for a smaller alternative . 
##i was immediately interested in the 6610 . 
##i have used this phone for two months now . 
size[+2],feature[+2]##not only is it the perfect size ( not too small , not too large ) , it also has all the features a high-tech phone user would want . 
##if you can live without an integrated camera , you wo n't miss much more . 
use[+1]##in true nokia style , the phone is simple to use and despite its delicate appearance , this little guy is as durable as other nokias i have owned . 
phone book[+2],speakerphone[+2]##the phone book is very user-friendly and the speakerphone is excellent . 
radio[+2]##even better , with the optional headset you can listen to music over the integrated radio . 
##if there are any drawbacks to this phone here they are . 
voice dialing[-2]##although i find it more convenient to use 1-touch dialing , this phone does not have voice dialing . 
key[-2]##the keypad is a decent size , but the power on/off key is small and difficult to press . 
battery life[+1]##however , the battery life is good enough you should n't be overly concerned with turning this phone off . 
volume control[-3]##in my opinion the worst issue on this phone is the side-mounted volume control . 
##it requires significant force to operate which can be scary on such a small phone . 
headphone jack[-1]##one other issue is that the headphone jack is unique to nokia , so standard headphones will not work . 
phone[+2]##overall this is the best phone i have ever owned . 
##any disadvantages are easily outweighed by its advantages . 
phone[+2][u]##nokia does not disappoint in this model . 
##go for it ! 
[t]awesome phone , great prices on amazon.com . 
##i could n't be happier with t-mobile either , i switched from cingular . 
screen[-2]##one complaint ... the screen is too easily scratched ! 
##but there are faceplates to replace it i guess ... 
##almost there . 
##i got this phone in t-mobile 's current customer retention program for very little money and no contract renewal . 
##i was getting so sick of my old motorola l7089 , but was waiting for the right phone to come along . 
##this is almost it but not quite but the price was right . 
##that said this phone does what it does extremely well - way better than anything motorola can produce . 
battery life[+2],radio[+2],signal[+2],speakerphone[+2],application[+1]##it has great battery life , fm radio , excellent signal , hands free speakerphone ( which i have to say is probably my favorite function ) and downloadable java apps . 
##what it lacks for me is n't available on one phone yet , namely gsm850 ( also sometimes known as gsm800 ) , bluetooth and edge . 
##so when the quad bands start appearing i will be upgrading again . 
##but for now this will do . 
##oh and before anyone comments yes i know motorola have announced a quad band edge bluetooth phone , but its not shipping at time of writing and the tri-band gsm850 phones lack the gsm900 band which is important if you like me globally roam . 
phone[+3]##great phone .. . 
feature[+3]##great features .. . 
[t]great plan . 
##i purchased this phone after having been an at &#38; t subscriber with a nokia 8260 phone for over three years . 
size[+1],speakerphone[+1],plan[+1]##i did a ton of research and settled on this phone because of the small size , speakerphone option , great priced calling plan and access to my corporate email . 
##i went to an at &#38; t store before i bought this phone to see if it was possible to get corporate email with any of their services and they looked at me like i had three heads . 
##they told me i would have to connect to my laptop , which had to be on and connected to my corporate network through the phone in order to access my corporate email . 
##with the t-mobile unlimited t-zones for $ 10 , i can check any number of email addresses and use unlimited internet . 
phone[+2]##i have had no problems with the phone . 
##friends of mine are always asking about it and wanting to use it . 
##i 've even had one friend buy one immediately after a test drive . 
phone[+2]##great phone , i 'd buy another . 
[t]excellent phone . 
phone[+3], look[+2]##excellent phone , the phone looks much better than what u see in the pictures . 
##bluetooth functionality would have made the phone even better . 
default ringtone[-3]##one more thing , the default ringtones that come with the phone are horrible . 
phone[+2]##overall an excellent phone . 
t-mobile[+2]##the service from t-mobile is very good too . 
##in all a winning combination . 
##worth every penny ! 
phone[+2],use[+1],network[+2]##great phone , easy to use , excellent network , no regrets ! ! ! 
[t]yo what a find . 
phone[+2]##i purchased this phone for just 50 $ and there is no end to what i can do with it . 
phone[+2]##nokia and t-mobile really teamed up well on this baby . 
##it puts an end to organizational deficiencies as well as communications and internet , without a bulky phone like the treo or something , which i had to cell because i was so unhappy with it . 
##now my little 6610 is the most coveted item at school ! 
##people have paid me money just to borrow it because its so elegant . 
service[+1],ringtone[+2]##service is great as far as i can tell , features work like a charm , ringtones are high quality if you buy them from t-mobile and aim is great . 
##now i can always be in contact . 
phone[+3]##this is probably your best bet if you are looking for a phone in this price range , or like me , do not have the patience to deal with annoying flip phones . 
##a great deal in general ! 
##i would not give up this phone for the world . 
phone[+2]##1 month , no problems , great phone i 'm very pleased with my 6610 phone . 
feature[+2]##yes , the features are numerous . 
speakerphone[+2]##the speakerphone works better than any speakerphone i 've ever had . 
##people i talk to on the speakerphone are shocked when it comes out at times that i 'm even using a speakerphone . 
sound quality[+2]##the sound quality is excellent , except , maybe a * tad * too quiet at times when there are quieter talkers on the other end of the line . 
earpiece[+3]##the included earpiece is very comfortable and easy to use . 
phone[+2]##i have not had any distortion problems with this phone and am more pleased with this phone than any i 've used before . 
##nokia has definitely won me over with this one . 
[t]best phone out there ... a+ not only is this the best phone out there but is cheap ( free ! ! ) . 
size[+2][u], look{+1]##first let me say that it is much smaller than it looks on the web and it also looks better . 
radio[+3]##the radio feature has superb sound quality . 
##i 've compared this phone to others such as 6100 , siemens sl55 . 
##even though they might be smaller many people seem to have alot of problems with them . 
design[+2]##it has a classic design yet looks hip . 
##is a lot better compared to the toy phone design of the nokia 7210 with its cheap feel . 
weight[+2][u]##it is extremely light and dissapears in your pocket . 
##for those that are looking for camera phones just get the camera attachement and comes with the stereo headphones to listen to the radio in style . 
battery[+2]##the battery is alot better than most of the phones out there . 
##one thing that i found out recently is that you do n't need t-zones from tmobile to go online . 
##every t-mobile plan comes with gsm data , meaning that instead of speeds of 56 kbps is around 9 kbps ( with those small size wap websites do you really think it makes a difference ) . 
##anyways there are ways to set up your 6610 to connect to csd which uses regular minutes and you are surfing the net , being able to download pics and ringtones ( not java apps , you need t-zones for that ) . 
##tmobiles might not have the best reception in some areas but with amazing phones such as nokia 6610 and cheap plans that you get way more minutes than any other plans . 
##if you thought about getting this phone buy it . 
phone[+2]##this phone is great as a whole and is not like others with one or two good qualities . 
[t]6610 = great phone and a few extras i am a person that needs my phone ( s ) on demand . 
##i currrently have service with t-mobile , verizon , and t-mobile . 
##the reason so many is that i am a contractor and all of my subs have these carriers and i can benifit from the mobile to mobile features that companies are now offering ! 
##that beside you are prob. very well aware of many of the features that this phone is known for , and one that has not yet been mentioned : using this phone as a modem for any computer with a usb 1.0 port ! 
##using the gprs option you can pay 19.99 extra a month and have unlimited internet access added to you account . 
##yes it is 56k speed , but the functionality is what you are paying for . 
##i myself find this great for when i am at a site i can run to my truck and hook up my modem cable ( 49.99 @ nokiausa.com or t-mobile.com ) press dial up on my laptop ( by the way it is a mac pb 1gz. and in a matter of seconds i can access my email , fax , and the entire web from my truck ! 
internet[-1]##the only problem that i have found with the internet service is that it does not access mls ( real estate broker software ) very well at all . 
##i find a great amount of value in this option for any and all the people that travel buy car and do not have access to the t-mobile " hot-spots " . 
browsing[+1]##it does well in all aspects of internet browsing . 
##as i also leave you with this review i would like to thank you for reading it . 
[t]sound good but complicated . 
##do too many stuffs to get to a free phone after rebate . 
##also , if i want a family plan , which mean i need tw phones on a plan .. . 
##so how can i do that ... are n't that free for two after the rebates . 
##and how can i do that ... . 
##print those coupons twice for two phones ? 
##... 
[t]do n't have the phone just commenting . 
##i saw another review saying his only gripe was a lack of voice dialing . 
##the phone does have voice dialing according to amazon & t-mobile and nokia . 
##the phone may look large but it is very small smaller then the 3390 phone . 
##my sister has this series of phone and she loves the radio and headset . 
game[-2]##i find the lack of entertaining games on this phone quite disturbing . 
##i do n't really like bounce . 
##i have always known nokia to provide me with good games on their phones . 
battery life[+2]##battery life is good for a phone of this size . 
voice dialing[+1]##but anyway , the only thing you should really look at here is the fact that the phone does have voice dialing . 
screen[+2],sound[+2]##great screen and great sound . 
##ok , everybody loves the fm radio in this , but you want a cell phone first , right ? 
phone[+2]##the 6610 excels as a cell phone , thank god . 
voice quality[+3],reception[+2]##the voice quality is very good , and it gets great reception ( that is , in places where you get t-mobile coverage , which is not that good ; see below ) . 
screen[+2],command[+2]##the color screen makes this free-after-rebates phone shine bright , and commands are very responsive . 
button[-2]##my only gripe about the hardware is the buttons . 
##nokia seems on a campaign to revamp the phone keypad , which imho is totally unnecessary . 
key[-2]##this model does have the traditional key arrangement , it 's just that they are really close to one another , and have unconventional shapes , so it takes a big getting used to for someone like me with big hands . 
##( to be fair , the same can be said about many korean imports , and the nokia 's build quality is light years ahead of the koreans . ) 
phone[+2]##other than that , this is a perfect phone for those of us with no patience for flips . 
t-mobile[-2]##finally , i reiterate my thumbs-down rating for t-mobile as a carrier . 
t-mobile[-2]##their network coverage is very sporadic , and the network always seems overloaded , resulting in very unpleasant calling experience . 
##if you can get this phone for cingular or at&t , go with the other carriers . 
[t]great phone , great service , no voice dialing . 
phone[+2]##the nokia 6610 is a relatively new phone , and what a great phone it is . 
##when i first saw the 6610 , i thought it was too small . 
size[+2]##after using it , i found the size to be perfect for carrying in a pocket . 
earpiece[+2]##it is just a tad small to hold to your ear with your shoulder , but that is solved with the very comfortable handsfree ear-piece which is included . 
##the ear-piece has a button that answers and hangs-up the phone so you do not have to mess with the phone at all , unless dialing a number . 
voice dialing[-2]##unfortunately , the 6610 does not offer voice dialing like my previous phone , but the other features it packs outweighs this shortcoming . 
screen[+2]##when i turned the phone on , the first thing that hit me is how good the screen is . 
resolution[+2], color[+2]##the resolution is very good and the colors are bright and even changeable ! 
##the phone has several color schemes you can choose from . 
##i like the default blue . 
##you can also set a background wallpaper . 
ringtone[+3]##the ringtones included are awesome , and did i mention they were polyphonic ? 
##no more annoying series of beeps . 
##this phone plays up to 4 tones at one time and it actually sounds like music . 
ring[+1]##you can also assign special rings and graphics to special people when they call . 
##the massive phonebook can hold 300 entries , with multiple phone number per entry , so you can program your boss 's home , work and cellphone numbers all under one contact . 
phone[+2]##the phone also sports an image gallery ( with option camera attachment ) , a calendar / organizer , alarm clock with snooze , fm radio ( way cool , even if it is just through an ear-peice ) , games , java applications and gprs high-speed internet connection . 
gprs[-1],t-zone[+2]##the gprs connection is sometimes slow , and writing instant messages with the included aol instant messenger software is a pain , but the other t-zones applications are quite useful . 
##you can get weather , movies , horoscopes and more with a few clicks . 
##the service deafults to showing the information associated with your billing zip code , but you can change the default and seach other areas while on the go . 
t-zone[-2]##one downside : as of this writing , t-mobile has n't updated their t-zone system to fully support the 6610 . 
##their website does not show it as a compatible phone , and should i try to access the game downloads on t-zones the system returns an error message saying my phone is not supported . 
##i have been assured this will be fixed soon . 
##now , for the t-mobile service : 
##i cannot say enough good things about the people who answer the phones . 
##if you have a question , they have the answer . 
##and should they not know it , they can find it out pretty quick . 
##every phone experience has started with a very brief time on hold followed by a cheerful representative answering the phone . 
t-mobile service[+2][u]##all my questions or problems have been quickly and satisfactorily resolved . 
##i 'd like to see my old carrier do that ! 
rate plan[+3]##the rate plans are also very good , at least for me . 
##different people have different needs , of course , but the t-mobile plans are priced very well for the minutes and services you receive . 
##the phone would have received 5 stars if the phone had voice dialing and the game downloads from t-zones worked . 
phone[+2]##this phone is highly recommended otherwise . 
[t]t-mobile ruins an otherwise good phone . 
phone[+2]##nokia makes a great phone , that 's clear . 
menu[+2], feature[+2]##with all its complicated features , the menus are easily accessible and the quality of the features is great . 
menu[-2]##the one huge disappointment is that the phones manufactured for t-mobile lack many of the menus and functions that a nokia straight from the manufacturer should have . 
##one of the things t-mobile brags about is the fact that it 's a " worldphone " and can be used in europe , etc. 
##yet they 've gotten rid of most of the languages that should be in the phone , including italian , german , and dutch . 
internet[-2]##the internet functions of the phone - wap and gprs - will only work through t-mobile 's services , because they have deleted the menu options that would enable you to configure the phone to be used on a different network . 
##therefore , if you wanted to travel abroad and pop in a local sim card , even if you unlock the phone , there is no way you can use the local wap browser or internet . 
##after spending hours being transferred from one tech help person to another , i got fed up and have decided to return the phone . 
##bottom line , if you 're attracted to this phone because of its tri-band feature so you can take it abroad , forget it . 
##find another phone , or buy this one in its manufacturer-unlocked form . 
[t]a good phone . 
phone[+2], feature[+2]##this phone is good with a huge array of features built into it . 
##i purchased the phone last week and have been using till then . . 
##i did n't had any problem till now . 
design[+2],screen[+2]##the design is sleek and the color screen has good resolution . 
weight[+2],signal[+2]##it is very light weight and has a good signal strength . 
sound quality[-2]##however , the main problem that i think is the with the sound quality . 
##it is not as good as the samsung phones that i have used earlier . 
voice[-2]##when talking the voice is not very clear . 
phone[+2]##but , i would definately recommend this phone . 
##go for it ... 
[t]people with bad audio quality have defective phones . 
##i have read a lot of the reviews and my phone does not have a hiss or anything that people are talking about . 
sound quality[+3][u]##it is crystal clear . 
phone[+3]##this is one of the nicest phones nokia has made . 
##i do recommend getting the data kit for those geeks . 
##there are a lot of cool websites with games and midi ringtones to download for free . 

[t]
SD500[+2]##We really enjoyed shooting with the Canon PowerShot SD500. 
design[+2]##It has an exterior design that combines form and function more elegantly than any point-and-shoot we've ever tested. 
image-processing system[+1]##A Digic II-powered image-processing system enables the SD500 to snap a limitless stream of 7-megapixel photos at a respectable clip, its start-up time is tops in its class, and it delivers decent photos when compared to its competition. 
image[+2]##The SD500 rivals the Canon G6 in image quality. 
##I've had it for about a month and it is simply the best point-and-shoot your money can buy. 
##I sincerely question the CNET reviewer's ability and/or their bias. 
##If you want something resembling a REAL and professional review before plunking down your $500.00, I suggest going to dpreview or dcresource and reading the reviews there. 
##I post under JTL at dcresource...check out my images if you want to see what this camera can do. 
pricey[-1]##I thought given all the "10" reviews about this camera that I would buy it in spite of being a bit pricey. 
LCD[-1]##I did see the review here and other places about a cracked LCD screen. 
##I figured that the few people who reported that the LCD screen cracked on them was episodic and it would never happen to me. 
##I received the SD500 on Monday, charged the battery and inserted the SD card that came with it, took a few pictures and waited until Thursday when the 2 GB SD card came that I had ordered. 
##The camera was sitting on my home desk waiting for the new digital card and the weekend for the first round of serious shooting. 
##It was NOT dropped or sat on or subjected to any other trauma -- it just sat on my desk in my home office  where no one goes but me. 
LCD[-1]##When I went to put in the new SD Card I looked at the LCD Screen -- CRACKED-- and the fluid gave a Jackson Pollock type appearance to the screen, black and blue and purple blotches and streaks --useless. 
##I have called Cannon they are sending me an RFA-- I will let you know if they treat me well or otherwise. 
camera[+3]##This camera is truely superb.
pictures[+2]##The startup time, quality of pictures and videos is outstanding.
manual control[-1]##Some more manual control would have been nice. 
##And shooters in low light should either select the iso manually and/or make sure that they don't shake much, as the camera's chip goes for detail over smoothness. 
##Also ensure that the low light focusing LED is pointing at the point you want in focus - and use the focus lock (something the cnet reviewer was obviously not familiar with).
##I have showed the pictures I have taken to many of my colleagues, alot of whom have expensive dslrs. 
pictures[+3]##They say that they are the best pictures they have ever see from a compact. 
##These are some shaky ones I took just after delivery:
Canon[+2]## I went out and got the Canon today. 
##WOW! Big difference! 
picture[+3]##I've taken about hundred shot with the Canon, in varying lighting situations, all in auto mode, and not one blurry picture!!! 
quality[+2],Sony[-2]##The quality, detail and clarity is much better than the Sony in my opinion. 
Canon[+3]##I did not conduct a rigorous test, but just took some identical shots in identical lighting with both cameras, and the Canon won hands down. 
pictures[+2]##Sharper pictures. 
##More detail. More natural color. 
size[+3]##The Canon is very small, definitely pocket size, but still easy to hold firmly. 
powers up[+3]##It powers up quickly, so you won't miss that quick shot. 
##I can't comment on most of the manual features of the camera because I've been shooting in auto mode, but based on my experience so far, manual adjustment, while available, won't be needed for most of the shots I will be taking. 
##Once I have the time, I plan to explore all the high end features of the camera, but for now, I can't comment intelligently or fairly. 
flash[-2]##The only knock I have is that the flash is underpowered. 
##This is a common problem with all ultra compacts, but I think I will probably go out and buy an external flash at some point. 
##A few of my indoor shots could have benefited from a stronger flash, but even those shots were not all that bad. 
image[+2]##Good image quality. 
##I expected more from a 7MP sensor and a Digic II processor. 
##Lacking a high speed/sports mode is something I'll never understand in a camera of this caliber and price. 
##You don't have a shutter or aperture priority mode...so the lack of a high speed program is a total dealbreaker for me.
pics[+2],user interface[+2],battery charger[+2]##All I have to say is that the pics I get with my SD500 are both rich and color and high in detail, the user interface is awesome, the battery charger is tiny and super light and SD cards are relatively cheap and getting cheaper all the time.
##I have had the SD500 for less than one week. 
LCD[-1]##After reading reviews of LCD problems, cracked, black blobs etc, I figured that it was probably a very limited problem. 
##Wrong, except that my problems are different. 
##Camera has been treated with kid gloves since day one. 
##Stored in a padded case. 
##Never abused. 
LCD[-2]##After 57 pictures total the LCD went black except for the icons showing the settings. 
##LCD works fine for reviewing images already on the card so it, the LCD, still works, however the camera will not allow new pictures to be taken. 
##Tried multiple cards both fast and slow speeds and different batteries. 
##All had the same results. 
weight[+2]##Camera is a paper weight. 
##Canon is fixing / replacing but 2 to 3 weeks turn around. 
##Expected better from a $500 unit.
SD500[+3]##I have been very impressed with my purchase of the SD500 I bought it at the beginning of the month as the ultimate pocket camera and have shot 300 images so far with it.
pictures[+2]##The pictures are tack sharp, colors are vivid, and at 7 mega pixels the quality is plenty high to manipulate and crop images to your hearts desire. 
Powerup[+2]##Powerup is quick, and you can even set your favorite image to display for a second or so as it turns on. 
640x480 mode[+2],quality[+2]##I have especially enjoyed the 640x480 mode, while not a replacement for a dedicated video camera, its quality easily surpasses that of my old Hi-8 camera and is perfect for quick clips of things that still images just dont describe (max 8 mins at 640 30fps on a one gig card). 
Camera shake[-2]##you can set the optical zoom before shooting and than while shooting video adjust a digital zoom in and out however due to the cameras light weight Camera shake is a problem to contend with. 
Audio[+1]##Audio is mono and fairly acceptable, quiet also with little distortions. 
##I have been fairly impressed with its ability to capture decent details in low light situations such as theaters, inside a bus at night ect
battery[+1]##The battery life is not that of the Casio's but its good and your going to get better pictures in my opionion with the battery life youve got. 
##If you use the LCD wisely and dont use it as a TV screen to show all your buddys the girl you went on a date with last night, you should be able to get plenty of shots in on a charge, I have only seen the warning light once, and that was after a week of daily occasional to medium duty use. 
##and even after the warning i had enough juice left to finish the evening with.
autofocus[-2]##The disadvantages of this camera is it has been having some trouble with its autofocus on a few occasional pictures, especially quick candid shots where you start up and shot as quick as you can. 
compact[-1]##I would imagine this is a problem with any camera of a compact nature. 
manual controls[-1]##Also as someone who at least knows a little bit about the technical work of taking a photo i really miss having manual controls. 
##But if you want a pocket camera to use when you cant take your Digital SLR with you that will capture quality images this is your choice of camera.
image[+2]##Glad to see the Ed. revised the previous statements regarding image quality. 
focuses[+2]##My SD500 focuses flawlessly, does not "whine" during video, and my pictures are razor sharp. 
##I can accept a little purple fringing on the ocassional difficult shot. 
##I don't miss the high speed program, nor the manual overide, since I had read numerous reviews and specs. before I ordered. 
camera[+2]##This camera is bulletproof. 
##It appears that actual owners of this camera all rate it at a 9 or 10 except for those others who are certainly entitled to their opinions. 
##Personally I love it! It's a definite 10!
start up[+3]##start up is so quick  
pictures[+1]##you can take pictures seconds after you turn the camera on...literally! 
##totally love this feature...very useful since i love taking pics of my 7-month old baby =)
lcd[+1]##big lcd screen - at least for me, 2" is enough
picture[+3]##great picture quality - in automatic mode, quality is great. 
quality[+2]##when you learn how to change some settings, you can make the quality even better 
zoom[+1]##digital zoom is clear too...say you used all 3x optical zoom, try to do digital zoom then...just try not to shake the camera at all and you'll still get a clear good quality picture
zoom[+1]##great video clip quality for a digital camera - so much better than my old one (Canon A60(?)...the 2.0 megapixel one). 
clips[+3]##i connected my camera to the tv and played some video clips and for a digital camera to take such good quality clips, i give it 5/5 stars =) oh and btw, while you take video clips, you can zoom it too! (digital zoom only though)...but still...(my old one can't do that...you have to zoom it first if you want then take the video clip.)
merge pictures[+1]##photo stitch (merge pictures to create a panoramic one..even my old one can do this and it's really cool to have it now still)
camera[+1]##turn the camera on while pressing the button (or is it the menu button? i have to check again =)) and it'l show you the time and date. 
##shake it a little bit and it'l change the background color. if you've holding the camera horizontally, then it will show the time and date horizontally. 
##change the orientation to vertical and it will automatically change the time and date orientation too. 
##i just thought it's cute and cool =)
battery[-1]## battery life is not long enough IF and ONLY IF you take a lot of video clips and play it back on the camera a lot of times...the camera/battery gets a little bit warm too when you use it for a long time but it's normal. 
##(i can't help but play with the camera always)
sound[-1]##the sound is not loud enough when i play back the video clips on the camera. 
##i don't know if i just got used to my A60 or it's just really not that loud. 
##but it's good enough since i upload them to the computer anyway (and sound is good too once you view it on the computer/tv).
camera[+3],pictures[+2]##i highly recommend this camera to anybody looking for a compact camera that can take good quality pictures. 
features[+3]##if you'll only read the whole manual, you'll find out even more cool features and you'll learn how to manipulate the quality you want to achieve and all those modes will make sense after reading 
##as a whole, i say, it's way more than what i expected. 
camera[+1]##it's such a great camera! i think it really was worth the investment =)
##i forgot to mention about the camera's design. 
designed[+2]##if you haven't noticed, they designed it so that you can also take vertical pictures when you do the self-timer. 
made[+2]##they made the other end of the camera flat so you can put the camera upright on a flat surface if you don't like to take the usual horizontal pictures using the self-timer.
camera[+2]##I bought this camera two days ago, and I'm very pleased to say that it has been worth the money. 
low-light conditions[-1]##Only downside is when taking pictures in low-light conditions without the flash. 
##The pictures tend to get blurry due to longer exposure, but his can be disabled in the manual settings. 
automatic settings[+2]##If you on the other hand always use automatic settings (and not manual) you should be just fine, as the camera features some of the best automatic settings I have ever seen.
camera[+1]##All in all, this is the camera for you if you can spare the extra cost in price. 
##But believe me, it's well worth it. 
Digic II chip[+3]##Having the Digic II chip helps a lot. 
pictures[+3],size[+3]##This camera takes amazing pictures and its size cannot be beat. 
starts up[+3]##I still can't believe how fast it starts up. 
camera[+3]##I take a lot of pictures and this camera is my first choice. 
sd500[+3]##I still have my s70 because I like the wider lens sometimes, but in general, if you are looking for a small camera with the whole package, the sd500 is the only one you should buy. 
edges[+2]##I love the rounded edges now, fits so much better in a pocket, jeans or suit. 
##Buy it, you will love it..... 
camera[+3],LCD[-2]##As much as I am happy about this great little camera, it is overshadowed by the fact that the LCD is easily spoilt.
LCD[-2]##The SD500 has only been in my possession for a little over 3 months, and the LCD has been broken twice. 
##The first time, I paid $165 (excluding shipping) to have it fixed by Canon Service Center. 
##I am still waiting news as to whether I will be charged for the 2nd time.
##I would not deny that some cameras are not treated with care. 
##However, it was not so in my case.
##$500 may not be a lot of money for some, but it is for me. 
##Treating my cameras, past and present, with utmost care ensures my investment. 
##In response to "testing" the LCD through pressure in the center and sides, I am glad that it did not cause any damage. 
##Otherwise, I would have changed my one-liner to "useless" instead of "flimsy".
##My SD500 was kept in a case all the time if not being used. 
LCD[-2]##I took it out one day and the LCD was not working. 
##Who knows maybe the service center did a sloppy job in fixing the camera the first time, that it is easily broken. 
LCD[-2]##Although the SD500 takes great quality photos, the sensitivity of the LCD compromises the quality overall.
##I read all the reviews on cnet, steve's, dpreview and a host of other sites before i decided to buy this camera. 
##All were generally favorable but i still had my doubts just because their review is based largely on the kind of photography that they do. 
camera[+2]##I tell you now, after lot of shooting in many different situations, this camera is amazing. 
##I Was hesitant to rate it a 10 just because it seems so extreme, however I really can't find anything wrong with it. 
size[+2]##The size of the camera is perfect. 
Fits[+2]##Fits comfortably in my inside jacket pocket or in my pants pocket. 
##When I was initially looking for a camera I thought that picture quality was my number one priority, however picture quality aint worth nothin if you leave the camera at home. 
##So i figured i would "compromise" and get the camera that i could, and would, take everywhere. 
##I Was wrong. 
camera[+2]##there was no compromise this little camera does amazing things. 
##In good light and low light the things a champ. 
pictures[+2]##I like to take pictures when I Go out at night and perhaps some people would complain that noise levels are high at higher iso's but I don't really care that much, i think it gives the pictures a certain real-life quality. 
flash[+2]##The flash is surprisingly good and even the video quality is excellent. 
##If you like to take a look at some pictures shot with this camera by a mediocre photographer please feel fee to check out my picture page at http://community.webshots.com/user/mbs60099
camera[+1]##I'd be happy to talk to anyone about this camera. 
##You will not be dissapointed!
camera[+2],movie mode[+3]##This camera is an excellent choice for an ultracompact, take anywhere device and boasts an outstanding movie mode to boot. 
instruction[+3]##The instruction manuals and documentation are excellent so that the learning curve will be much less steep.
camera[+2]##I've only had this camera for a few days, but it's been great. 
photo[+3]##The photo quality is amazing. 
feels[+3],looks[+3]##it's fast, feels great in your hand and looks great too. 
prints[+3]##I've printed several photos and the prints look as good as the screen views.
image[+2]##As any digital camera owner knows is that when you go to take a picture of a moving object to expect some blurring but with some preliminary testing we had somone move there hands back and forth under the lense and another person take the picture and suprisingly a crystal clear image apeared on the decently sized screen. 
colors[+3],video[+3]##another thing i like about this camera is the way that you can swap colors around and the impressive video quality i would advise any person in the market for a camera to pay the little extra on the hefty $500 price tag and get a quality camera.
camera[+2]##Moreover, apart from the plastic cable cover, the camera has a nice, solid feel about it, and it's so tiny, I take it with me wherever I go. 
##Highly recommended.
camera[+2]##As it turns out, this is an awesome camera! 
##If you want one you better hurry up - supply is low and demand is high which means prices may go way up!
##The CNET review does not give this camera the review it deserves. 
##CNET told you not to look for advanced controls. 
preset[+3],user definable[+3]##However, this ultracompact allows the photographer to personalize his or her shooting preferences through a variety of preset and user definable modes. 
advanced controls[-1]##I also own a Canon Digital Rebel and I agree that the advanced controls on the SD500 are not as robust, but overall picture quality goes head-to-head with the Digital Rebel. 
software[+1],documentatio[+2]##The SD500 software install was seamless and the product documentation is very detailed. 
camera[+1]##Bottom line, this camera will give you a lot of bang for the buck!
pictures[+2]##I don't know why CNET says there is a problem with focus, I have all my pictures sharp and high quality. 
##Sometimes indoor with poor light you can notice small noise. 
##I had G600(6MP) before this one and I noticed big difference in picture quality and performance using SD500. 
##If you don't care about manual controls then its for you!
camera[+1]##Very good "every day" camera. Fits nicely in the pocket of my jeans and takes quality photos.
looking[+2],fast[+3]##If you want a sharp looking, fast digital camera and you don't need or want manual controls, then this is the camera for you! 
##Great for 1st time digital camera owners who are learning the "digital" way of the photo taking force (like me) or for the experienced digital photographer who wants a powerful, easy to keep with you at all times camera.
camera[+3]## am so glad I bought this camera. 
SD500[+3]##All the good reviews for the SD500 are true. 
view finder[+3]##The view finder shows crystal clear pictures that will look even better when you get them to the computer. 
software[+3]##The included software removes any red eye easily. 
pics[+3],small[+3]##if you are looking for a small camera to throw in your pocket, take great pics and video, get the SD500. 
##Also make sure you pick up a good high speed SD card like the SanDisk Ultra 2.
camera[+1]##This is overall the best point and shoot camera I've used. 
##Unlike many other compact PS cameras this camera has an AF assist lamp essential for focusing in dark areas. 
buttons[+3],user interface[+3]##Placement of the buttons and software user interface is near perfect. 
power button[-1]##The only problem I have with the buttons is that the power button and print/share button don't have a nice click. 
buttons[-2]##The buttons are rather stiff. 
switch[+3]##I also tend to like the sliding cover/on switch found on many compact PS cameras since it's much faster and easier to power on if you need to take that instant shot. 
build[+1],macros-results[+2],video-quality[+3],flash[+3],white balance[+3]##overall build quality, good macros-results, impressive video-quality, good pictures with flash (good colours, sharp results), excellent auto white balance.
camera[+1]##Could be better to be a perfect camera (and some competitors do some of this better): purple fringing, details in high-light area, noise over ISO100, red-eyes, (few)processing artefacts, (few)loss of some details especially of the hairs of peoples in low light, automatic autofocus, whizing while video-playback, better video comression (smaler viedo-files), more manual controls, longer lasting battery, indicator for battery, better protection of the LCD, less weight. 
camera[+2],image[+1]##When the overall image quality (especially natural colours, details, natural looking of the pictures) is the most important thing, then this camera ist top notch and very impressive. 
flash[+3]##In low light with flash I found it clear better then the sony P200 (too much red, colours overall not as natural but fewer red-eyes). 
##The Fujifilm F10 is probably the best compact camera for low light (ISO 400 with not much noise, even ISO 800 is relative good). 
##I have see impressive pictures of this camera but also some who are not as detailed as of the Ixus SD500. 
##For me the colors of the Casio-cameras (Z750, Z50)aren't by far as good as that of the SD500, the pictures looks more artificial and over processed. 
settings[-1]##Some adjustments in the settings could help make it better.
focus[+1]##I found best results in most situation with manual/center auto focus, manual mode, ISO 100 (shorter aperture-time, so more often sharper images as with ISO 50), auto white balance (auto white balance is better than of the other canon cameras I have and they already do very-well).
camera[+1]##I upgraded from a very small 3.2 mpxl camera to this camera with great results. 
color[+3]##Good color and very little needed to correct photos on Paintshop Pro. 
Picture[+1]##Neat feature for self-timer allows you to record two different warnings. 
##I use "get ready" and "here it comes". 
manual[+3]##The manual is excellent. 
##Get the Ultra SD card which allows very quick turnaround on shots. 
##To limit lag time, turn off flash or if flash needed, turn off display. 
multiple picture[+3]##Also, multiple picture feature is very, very fast.
powerup[+2],multiple pictures[+3]##Very fast powerup and great speed when taking multiple pictures. 
size[+3]##Perfect size! Beats the competition by leaps and bounds. 
##Check out the other professional reviews for this camera on the web. 
##CNET unfortunately is greatly underrating this camera in its editorial review. 
##Check this one out for yourself for sure!
##I have not been this happy about a purchase I have made in a long time. 
##I highly recommend this camera! I can shoot continuous 640x480 60 fps video until my 1gig SD card fills up! 
camera[+1]##I am impressed with this camera inside and out.
##This is my third digital Elph and it is definitley the best ever. 
##Finally a Canon with a setting for Snow White Balance. 
camera[+3]##I love the camera.
compact[+2],photo[+3]##This camera is perfect for the person who wants a compact camera that produces excellent photos in just about any situation. 
##Flash works well for a compact, red eye is a minor problem. 
responce[+3]##The camera responce is VERY quick. 
##Almost no lag between button activation and shutter. 
##Camera powers on and ready in about a second. 
pics[+1]##I have a Canon A 70 , and now this SD500, its amazing, how this little camera produces, such great pics, it even brings out ur pimples on the face. 
##that u missed in the mirror! 
##Once I learned how to use the diferent features, it is much easier than my old one to use and view pics. 
video[+3]##And the video quality is amazing. 
##On the 60fps setting it seems like a regular video recorder!! 
fits[+3]##And it fits right in my pocket much easier than my old S30. 
##An A++!!!
camera[-1]##I thought this camera was awful and I did tons of research on CNET and other sites. 
automatic shutter[-3]##There were many times when I clicked the automatic shutter and nothing happens. 
##It seems you have to double click some of the time, but not all of the time. 
##Huh? I missed out on lots of photos and lots and lots came back blurry. 
controls[-1]##The controls are hard to manipulate, especially in the dark. 
LCD[-2]##The LCD screen is too small since there are so many cameras that have larger ones.
[t]
small[+1]##I want to start off saying that this camera is small for a reason.
##Some people, in their reviews, complain about its small size, and how it doesn't compare with larger cameras.  
camera[+3],size[+2]##I'm in high school, and this camera is perfect for what I use it for, carrying it around in my pocket so I can take pictures whenever I want to, of my friends and of funny things that happen.
memory[-2]##The only thing I don't like is the small size (8 MEG) memory card that comes with it.
room[-2]##I have to move pictures off of it every day so I have room for more pictures the next, and I don't have enough money to buy the 256 MEG card that I've had my eye on for a while.
memory[-1][s],battery[-1]##A larger memory card and extra battery are good things to buy.
pictures[-2]##Other than that pictures taken in the dark are not as nice as I'd like them,
camera[+3]##I'd say that this camera is perfect.
[t]
compact[+2]##OK, not quite everything...but this camera is so compact that you will have it by your side when you need it.
[t]
size[+2]##I bought this camera for the same reason many of you are considering it, or have already bought it--it's size.
small[+3]##It is amazingly small, it's hard to believe all that has been packed into this camera.
##I take it with me everywhere,literally, 
small[+3],durable[+2]##it is so small that I am able to keep it in my pocket, and I don't have to fear that it will get ruined in my pocket because it is so durable.
covering[+2]##There is also a small covering for the lens, so you need not worry that the lens will get scratched.
picture[+3],small[+2]##The picture quality surprised me, when I first saw this camera I saw how small it was an instantly assumed that the picture quality would not be good--but I was wrong!
picture[+3]##The picture quality of this camera is outstanding (taking its' size and price into consideration).
##However, I do have a few things to complain about...  
battery[-2]##First off, the battery.
battery[-2]##This camera uses a lithium battery, I find lithium batteries to be highly inconvenient; because what if you are on vacation, where the nearest place to buy batteries is just a gas station--there is no way that you are going to find lithium batteries there.
battery[-2]##Not only is it inconvenient, but also the battery life span is short.
##The longest I've had it work was about 1 hour and 45 minutes.
batteries[-1]##This isn't uncommon in cameras, though, just as long as you bring your charger and spare batteries, you should be fine.
zoom[-2]##Another problem I had with this camera was the zoom function.
zooms[-2]##Such a small zoom length that you would think that the zoom would be silent since it hardly zooms in...wrong!
##Very wrong.  
zoom[-2]##The zoom function on this camera is so loud that sometimes you will be unable to use it if you find yourself in a situation where you must be quiet.
start-up[-2]##Even just turning the camera on will move the lens a little, resulting in a noisy start-up.
flash[-2]##The flash is very weak.
##Really dissapointing. If you are inside, you can't be any farther away then 10 feet in a lit room.
macro[-2]##The last problem I found with this camera was the macro function.
auto-focus[-2]##The auto-focus on the camera seems to have trouble focusing on the subject.
work[-2]##To make matters work, there is no manual override to overcome this problem.
focus[+2]##The focus is great, though, if you are not taking a macro shot.
##These are all the flaws I found in the camera, 
cameras[-1][cc]##it's not my first choice in cameras,
size[+2]##I have come across many other beginner cameras that I prefer over this camera, but the thing you have to keep in mind about this camera is the size.
camera[+2]##If you are just looking for something to keep with you at all times, then this is a great camera choice.
[t]
##I researched digital cameras for a month before purchasing the s100... 
s100[+2]##after considering my needs further and researching the marketplace, I decided on the s100.
[t]
##I have had this little gem for four months now. 
camera[+2]##It has given me zero problems, and the more I use it, the better I become at taking advantage of its strengths.
##I had a regular Canon Elph (APS), as well as a JVC digital camera.
##I was looking for a blend of the two and so I bought this camera. 
##I'll share some observations that may differ a bit from what other reviewers have noted. 
small[-1]##1) It is perhaps too small. 
buttons[-2],read[-2]##I find it a bit difficult to manage the very tiny buttons and impossible to read the icons without my reading glasses on.
size[-2]##Its size makes holding it steady for long a bit of a challenge (not enough camera body to grip with more than your finger tips).
delay[-2],shots[-2]##2) The delay from the time you fully depress the shutter to the time the picture is taken is too long and may yield some fuzzy shots. 
autofocus[-2]##This is due to the unusually slow autofocus system.
resolution setting[-1]##3) The lack of an intermediate resolution setting, as other reviewers have suggested, is a problem, but that problem is meaningless with a larger CompactFlash memory card
##(I got a 64 meg card for $... and it holds 105 pics at 1600 x 1200 res).
hot[-2]##4) The camera gets really hot when you are busy snapping away.
hot[-2]##It is hot enough to be annoying.
##Canon says it's normal. 
##I have found it gets less warm with the LCD off.
[t]
small[+3],pictures[+3]##This wonderfully small digital camera produces fantastically good pictures printed on any decent photo-quality printer (with photo quality paper).
snapshots[+1][cc]##It will not replace your high-end 35mm SLR but it's a great toy to keep near you at all times for snapshots.
[t]
##I have used many digital cameras. 
camera[+3]##This IS the best camera you can have for digital images if you want to:
pictures[+2]##Take quick pictures with excelent resolution
wait[+2]##Hate to wait between shots
Download[+2]##Download it fast to your computer
bundled software[+2]##Have a great and easy to use bundled software
size[+2]##Travel with it without knowing you have it in your pocket
[t]
Battery[+1]##FYI, Battery doesn't die if you don't use LCD
color and light[+3]##The color and light I captured with this camera on a 12-day trip to Turkey (gorgeous vividly colored ceramic tiles inside darkened mosques) were far superior to anything I've ever gotten with a traditional 35-mm film camera.
camera[+3]##I love this camera.
[t]
camera[+1]##I don't believe this camera is still available. But if you can find one, you might like to get it.
smallest[+3],best-built[+3]##It's still one of the smallest 2MP digital cameras on the market, and absolutely one of the best-built most stylish cameras ever.
[t]
##I bought my camera based on recommendations from my other friends who own it. 
purchase[+2]##I am very pleased with my purchase.
##It's best to list the pros and cons of this camera:
[t]
camera[+3]##I've been incredibly happy with this camera.
camera[+2][cc]##This camera is great if you're used to a high-end SLR.
snapshots[+1][cc]##It's overkill for simple snapshots, unless you've got way too much money to blow.
Exposure[+1]##Exposure compensation in 1/3 stop increments (I leave it set on +1/3 stop to brighten up the default exposure, which goes a bit dark for my taste).
flash[+2], mode[+2]##Slow-syncro flash, macro/infinity mode, etc.
zoom range[-1],small[+2]##The zoom range is a little narrow (35-70mm in 35mm film equivalent), but given that the camera is the same as my wallet, I can't think of any real complaint.
body[+2]##The SS body is wonderful, feels high-quality.
[t]
body[+2][cs]##It's the same body as the popular ELP2 APS camera (take a look at a standard credit card from your wallet and you'll have an idea of the front profile!).
##A 2X optical zoom (you can pretty much ignore any time a  manufacturer refers to "digital zoom")
[t]
lcd[-3]##I left the camera in my car in Maine (not a very hot place) and the LCD screen cracked !
design[-2]##I then realized a major design flaw.
functionality[-2]##All the camera's functionality is only available (or selectable) when the screen is functional.
screen[-2]##When the screen stops working, you're out of luck !
[t]
##I wrote another review and this is the update. 
manual mode[+3]##I discovered that the camera has a manual mode that gives you total control over exposure, white balance, flash (red eye, person against bright background, flash on, flash off, flash automatic).
[t]
##I have used this camera for about 3 weeks so far, taking over 500 pictures. 
##I have 2 batteries and a 128 mb card. 
##Here are some useful facts:- 
##On a battery charge, the camera takes approximately 70 pictures, where the camera is opened and closed between pictures. 
##A 64mb card stores approximately 100 pictures at default resolution (ie between 500k and 1.5mb per picture). 
viewfinder[-2]##The viewfinder does not accurately represent the pucture being taken.
##The LCD should be used.
##However, in dark settings you must use the viewfinder. 
zoom[-3]##The digital zoom is crap.
##Turn it off. 
fits[+2]##It fits in your pocket.
##The closest competitor is the SONY DSC-P1 (3.3mp). 
##But that camera is a little larger and you defeat the whole purpose of having a truly portable camera.
##I take my camera everywhere. 
##Tamrac makes a tiny pouch that is best for the camera. 
##The front even has a zipper for an extra battery and your wallet stuff. 
panorama setting[+3]##The panorama setting is unbelieveable !
##You take around 12 pictures in a circle, stitch them together and voila; you have a perfect memory of where you were standing ! 
pictures[-1]##The pictures are a little dark sometimes.
flash[+1]##You have the option to have the flash automatic or off.
[t]
S100[+2]##The new Canon s300 is 33% larger and 26% heavier than the S100.
movie mode[-1]##The movie mode can only record a max of 30 seconds at 160X120 per clip and a max of 4 seconds at 640X480.
mode[+2][cs]##It has one more resolution of 1024X768 and a "Normal" compression mode.  And, it has the 3X zoom.
price[-1][cs]##The price is $... more.
[t]
software[-3]##I originally gave this camera 5 stars. When I had Windows 98 it was wonderful but I got a new computer last November with XP the usb software is Sooo... not compatible with XP
##I have found however that you can just buy a card reader to solve this problem.
drivers[-1]##The new drivers on cannon's site do not help at all but try them if you want they have made me have to use the backup software.
software[-2]##The Adobe software also was wonderful in 98 but it will not let you print correctly with XP so you are forced to create your document then either print it from Windows or export it to another application.
pictures[+3]##But it takes gorgeous pictures for a 2.1 MP camera.
[t]
camera[+3]##I love this camera!
memory[-2][s]## the only thing I don't like about it is that You have to buy a larger memory card, first thing!
[t]
price[+3]##I got this camera for an unbelievably low price at amazon.
camera[+3]##I would recommend this camera unequivocally!
[t]
camera[+3]##I got this camera for an unbelievably low price at amazon.
camera[+3]##I would recommend this camera unequivocally!
[t]
##My last digital camera was an Apple QuickTake 200, which shot 640x480 pixel images.
##The Apple was actually better in two repects: it turned-on quickly and it showed you what you just shot right after you shot it.
##The  ELPH will do the latter but you must hold down the shutter button to view  it.
battery[+2]##But this DOES work even if you turn off the LCD viewing -- great  battery saver.
[t]
##I've been using this camera for a few months now.
camera[+2]##A great camera, but here are some points which I don't notice in most of the reviews here, which may be of concern especially to the more advanced amatuer:
[t]
##Good quality and fun!
Elph s100[+2]##I purchased the Elph s100 mainly because I thought it was cool.
##I'm a professional photographer using pro digital equipment and I was looking for something to have around the house so that my wife could capture candid moments with my kids.
##In practice, we've been VERY happy with the results.
exposure[+2],prints[+2][cc]##The camera does a great job with exposure and prints made with my professional printer looks great (not as good as prints from my pro digital camera, but still VERY good).
[t]
##My last digital camera was the Canon Powershot A5 Zoom, which I liked  quite a bit.
smaller[+1],resolution[+1]##But I was ready to upgrade and when I discovered that Canon  was going to come out with an even smaller digital camera with a higher  resolution, I had to have the S100.
[t]
S100[+3][cc]##This is my second digital camera, but I'm much more impressed with the Canon S100 Digital Elph than I EVER was with my Kodak DC240.
light[+3][u],tiny[+3][u]##This camera is so light and tiny that I literally carry it everywhere with me, which is great considering I'm an artist and like to capture interesting items for future painting.
software[+2]##The software that comes with the Digital Elph is very nice and intuitive.
##I especially like the way that ZoomBrowser EX lets you look at a virtual filmstrip of your pictures.
software[+2]##The PhotoStitch software is very cool if you want to do any 360 degree panorama shots.
##I'd suggest that you not only buy this camera, but the case for it and an extra battery pack.
on-camera controls[-1]##My only complaint and the reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is that the on-camera controls aren't as intuitive as they should be.
work[-1][u]##I've often struggled to get something to work the way I want it, and hate to have to carry the manual with me all the time!
camera[+2]##Other than that, I love this camera.
pictures[+3],color rendering[+3]##The pictures are uniformly excellent and color rendering is perfect.
[t]
size[+2],metal case[+1],use[+2],picture quality[+1],software[+2]##The good:  Small size; durable-seeming metal case; easy to use; visually distinctive; good picture quality; fast USB connection; mostly intuitive operation; really cool PhotoStitch software that knits pictures together to give wide panoramas.
[t]
size[+3],S100[+1]##If compact size is your highest priority in a 2-megapixel camera, the Canon PowerShot S100 Digital Elph is a standout choice and aptly named for its diminutive design.
image quality[+1],weighs[+2]##The S100's image quality rates in the middle of its class, but it can still be a reasonable choice for students, families, or small businesses looking for an ultra-portable camera that weighs less than half a pound with media and battery pack.
[t]
##Recently I was at dinner with some friends, and we were debating the merits of one digital camera vs. another.
##One of my friends was going on and on about his camera and how fancy it was.
##While he was talking, I took my S100 out of the front pocket of my Levi's and took his picture.
##I said, can your fancy camera do that?
##No, because he doesn't (can't) always carry his with him.
##End of story.
[t]
camera[+3]##I purchased this camera before it went on sale, and while I wouldn't have minded keeping the extra $$$, it was definitely worth it.
product[+3]##I have been absolutely, completely satisfied with the product and its capabilities.
##I am no computer expert, and this is my first (and probably last) digital camera.
product[+3]##This is a great product, and Canon has done an excellent job.
[t]
##I've been very reluctant to join the digital camera communitysince I've been an avid "legacy" photographer for most of mylife.
jewel[+3][u]##I received this little jewel as a gift and I can honestly say Iabsolutely love it.
usability[+2],performance[+2],expandability[+2],looks[+3]##I give this product five stars for its usability,performance, expandability, and definitely looks!
[t]
##I've had this camera for three years.
##price[-1][u]I bought it new, when it was cutting edge and very expensive.
##I put a 128MB CF card in it.
camera[+2],software[+2]##First, I have to say that I have NEVER had the slightest problem with this camera or the software.
##I've probably taken upwards of 5000 pictures with it, it's been all over the country.
software[+2]##The software has been installed on Windows 95, 98, 2000 and XP and I haven't had any problems with it.
camera[+1],performs[+1],picture[+2],battery[+1]##The camera is solid, performs well, takes good pictures, and the battery lasts pretty long if you disable the LCD viewfinder.
##If battery life were that big a deal, one could purchase a second battery and rotate.
pictures[-1]##All that said, I am a little disappointed with the quality of the pictures from the camera.
sharp[+3],color balance[+3],focus[+2]##They are razor sharp, the color balance is perfect, and the focus is great.
pictures of people[-3]##When taking pictures of people, however, it shows EVERY flaw in the subject's skin.
##Scratches, oil, freckles are magnified and come out looking horrific.
##It requires extensive Photoshopping to fix the flaws.
pics[-2][cc]##Other cameras taking pics of the same subjects turn out looking much better.
processing[-1]##I will also say that it takes a very long moment for the camera to do its digital image processing between the time you press the button and when the camera actually takes the picture.
##By the time the shot's taken, something (especially a squirmy child or a sports play) has invariably moved and it's not the exact picture you wanted.
##I'm going to buy a real Single-Lens Reflex (SLR) to take baby pictures, but I'll keep this as a travel camera.
[t]
##I'm a writer and new to digital photography.
##I've owned a few 35mm cameras over the years, including one SLR and two point & shoots.
##I had been waiting for the prices of digital cameras to come down before  taking the plunge.
##This year, with a cruise to Nova Scotia coming in  August, I decided the time was right and just purchased a Canon S100  Digital Elph.
camera[+3]##I must say, I think this is the coolest camera I've ever  owned!
size[+3]##First, it really is tiny; the size of a pack of cigarettes, maybe  a scooch deeper.
##The included battery charger is larger!
use[+3]##Second, it is  incredibly easy to use.
photos[+2]##I just went on a quick photo shoot in NYC's  Central Park today, and what a bunch of beautiful photos I took, if I do  say so myself (and I do!)
use[+2][cc]##The camera is as easy to use as a point and  shoot, and with instant review on the LCD screen, you can retake any  flubbed shots on the spot.
optical zoom[+2],cap[+1]##The two-times optical zoom operates smoothly  and quietly, and lo and behold, a two-piece shutter-like cap automatically  slides closed over the lens when you turn the camera off.
software[+2]##I also had no  problems installing or running the camera software on my PC.
##I'm still  learning about file sizes (and how large is too large to email), and I did  erase one photo I wanted to keep as I was getting used to the menu system.
##But otherwise I am thrilled to have taken the plunge into digital  photography.
##And there are two more advantages to digital photography  which I hadn't anticipated, beyond the lack of film and developing.
##One is  the lack of censorship of your photos -- time for some, uh, fashion  photography of your wife or girlfriend, if that's something you both would  enjoy!
##Another is the ability to upload images from your PC to a memory  card in the camera.
##This is a great source of personal entertainment for  travelers, if you catch my drift, and you can zoom in on the LCD images!
##I  would also recommend Canon's soft case for the camera, which has a slot to  attach to your belt along with a second nicely finished compartment to hold  an extra battery or memory card.
##As other reviews have noted, you will  definitely want one or more additional memory cards.
##I've found I can get  from nine to twelve compressed 1600 X 1200 photos on one 8MB card, or 28  images uploaded from my PC.
S100[+2]##At any rate, if you have been interested in  digital photography but the price and confusion have held you back,  consider the Canon S100 Digital Elph.
camera[+2]##It really is the perfect travel  camera, plus it offers the convenience of digital photography.
[t]
##Why did I wait so long?  detail[-1],color rendition[-1][cc]##If you're looking for a digital camera to replace your big Nikon or Canon SLR, forget it - film is still king when exquisite detail and fine color rendition are critical.
##Before you give up on digital cameras, though, ask yourself a few questions: 
[t]
##got this as it flew off the shelves.
use[+2],images[+2],fits[+1][u]##Really like it, easy to use, great images, very intuitive, fits in my jacket pocket.
##What else can I say?     
[t]
compact[+1][u],rugged[+1],use[+1]##I was looking for a compact, rugged (I carry it hiking, skiing, boating, etc) camera which is easy to use.
memory expansion[+1],macro mode[+1],housing[+1]##I wanted standard memory expansion (CF cards), macro mode, and if possible, a waterproof housing (for kayaking).
##This is the only camera with all these capabilities.
small[+2]##Even with the waterproof housing it is small.
lens[+1]##The lens retracts and has its own metal cover so you don't need to fuss with a lens cap.
housing[+1]##The metal housing seems very rugged.
##Turn-on to ready-to-shoot is about 3 seconds.
automatic modes[-1]##I'd give it  5 stars if the automatic modes were better and if there were true manual focus and exposure modes.
auto mode[-1]##For example, in auto mode you can't use the flash redeye reduction, you must be in manual mode for that.
auto color balance[-1]##The auto color balance is often fooled by dense clouds.
##You need to use the manual exposure adjustment in backlight or bright light conditions such as with snow in the background.
dynamic range[-1][cc]##The dynamic range seems not quite as good as the Kodak DC260.
macro mode[+1]##The macro mode works well, although it takes some practice since the camera doesn't clearly indicate when it can't focus.
LCD[+1]##The white-LED backlit LCD is very bright and crisp, even in sunlight, and relatively easy on the battery.
panorama modes[+2]##The panorama modes are wonderful.
##Buy at least two batteries and you'll never run out in the field.
##High-res photos take 1-1.5 MBytes each so you want a CF card sized accordingly.
small[+3][u],light[+3][u]##It's so small and light, even with a spare battery, you really can take it anywhere.
auto mode[+1]##In auto mode anyone can use it as a point and shoot camera.
manual modes[+1]##The manual modes give you a lot of control over exposure and white balance (but there is no manual focus or manual exposure).
##1600x1200 means really good, cropped 5x7 prints and acceptable 8x10s.
light[+1],compact[+1]##There are better cameras but none anywhere near as light and compact.
##It's a little jewel.
[t]
Small[+1]##1- Small.
smal[+2]##VERY smal.
##You'll carry it with you every day.
##I've been taking near 100 pictures per month since I got mine.
cameras[+2][cc]##I've had a lot of cameras, but this one is ACTUALLY being used, and not stored in a desk: it's allways in my shist pocket.
picture quality[+3],use[+2][u]##2- Excellent picture quality and so simple to use!!!
##Fool proof.
##I started shooting even before reading the manual (not recommended at all).
##3- USB kicks!
##2 secs to download a 600KB 1600x1200 picture!
Looks[+1][u]##4- Looks great.
case[+1]##Silver metal case -NOT PLASTIC.
software[+3]##5- Excelent software package.
TFT screen[+1]##6- Small but very clear TFT screen.
##Take shots at angles you thought you wouldn't.
TFT[+1]##Don't care about sunlight: it's TFT.
panorama mode[+2]##7- 360 panoramic pictures are a very big deal.
buttons[-1]##8- Buttons are little, but If you have steady fingers and dealed with a casio wirst calculator watch, you can deal with almost anything.
buttons[-1]##Buttons size is OK for me, my wife, but not my grany.
##9- Cons? Not a single one after 5 months.
[t]
canon s100[1][cc]##i researched and researched between getting the canon s20 or the canon s100, and of course i got the latter!
##and i'm glad i did!
[t]
ease of use[+2][u],picture detail[+2][u]##I was looking for something that wasn't too complicated to use and to help the pics I post on Ebay show more detial.
size[+3][u],casing[+2]##This camera is great, wonderfully small, and has attactive hi-tech casing.
ease of use[+3]##Very easy to use for someone like me who's just hopping on the digital camera bandwagon.
##I love not having to go to Walgreen's to get my pictures develpoed anymore!
##Definitely a good investment.
[t]
controls[+2],ease of use[+2][u]##The controls are easy to understand and big enough that they are easy to see and use.
##I would recommend spending a little money and this will be the perfect digital camera.
##I added a second battery (about $69, recharges in about two hours) and a large (192Mb for less than $400) CF module.
##Now I can take over 300 1600 x 1280 shots (or for the webshot fanatic, 1,141 pictures at 640 x 480).
zoom[+1]##The optical and digital zooms combine to give an effective 4x zoom.
capacity[+2]##This is enough capacity and capability to do a complete household inventory, for example.
##While this might seem pricy, I have been spending $27 for 25 APS images, with prints and a CD, so this camera will pay for itself in a year.
[t]
##I have a 35mm camera outfit that cost quite a bit of money a few years ago.
size[+1]##So, why the small Digital Elph, rather than one of the other cameras with better resolution or picture quality? size[+2]##because, unless it's small, I won't cary it around.
##If I won't cary it around, I won't use it, and if I won't use it, what's the point?
[t]
##My first impression of Elph S100 was that there couldn't POSSIBLY be room in the thing for anything other than a battery and a memory card.
##Somehow, the engineers at Canon did it, and the results are nothing less than astounding.
[t]
##I was a little skeptical about what people had said about this camera, because it's just so small.
size[+1][u],pictures[+2]##After getting one for Christmas from Amazon, I'm now a believer:  The Digital Elph is truly the world's smallest digital camera that shoots great pictures.
[t]
pictures[+2]##I've had this camera just over 2 years and it takes pretty good pictures.
size[+3]##The size is tiny, which I love.
##We bought extra memory and a backup battery (so we can use one while the other is charging).
pictures[-1]##Sometimes the pictures are onthe dark side, but I'm able to fix that using the Photoshop 6.0 "adjust levels" function ... not sure how a person would do that without Photoshop, though.
[t]
##OK so I bookmarked pages about this camera on our home computer, in a place I was sure my wife would see, and loh and behold, what did I get.
##Thank you Santa!
[t]
##I bought this camera at the end of August.
##With the camera I also bought a 128MB compact flash card, an extra battery, and a carrying case.
##I also recently bought Viking's IntelliFlash Memory Reader.
[t]
##I've got a couple of digital cameras.
##An Olympus 2500 and an Olympus 620.
##Really like them,  they work well and the macro function of the 2500 really helps my Ebay biz.
##BUT they are big cameras,  they have to reside in a large case,  they need all kinds of batteries,  in short they're a pain to lug around.
[t]
##I've struggled for years with supposedly high-quality point and shoot 35mm cameras delivering astonishingly inconsistent results.
##The Canon S100 destroys this problem.
##I've had this camera for roughly 3 weeks now and I've taken approximately 250 pictures.
##The results are superb...  both in print and over the computer.
[t]
##Positives:
[t]
ease of use[+3][u]##This camera is so easy to use!
##I just took it out of the box, charged the battery, and started taking pictures.
features[+3]##All the features are incredibly intuitive, even for a novice like me.
##I would recommend getting a larger Compact Flash card, because once you start taking pictures, you won't want to stop.
pictures[+3],size[+3]##The pictures are beautiful, and the camera is so small you can carry it anywhere.
[t]
price[+2],features[+2],size[+2],ease of use[+2]##I, as many others, have waited for many years for the convergence of price, features, size and ease of use to hit that happy center point.
##Well wait no more!
[t]
fun[+3]##I bought this little guy a few weeks back, and I have to saythat I never had so much fun with a new toy as this.
size[+3]##You willdefinitly appreciate the small size.
##You can take it anywhere withyou, unlike other bulky cameras, and capture every moment of yourlife.
##Don't get this...keep browsing. 
##The iPod has so far been one of the most advertised and populated MP3 players so far. 
##I'm still figuring out why.
features[-2]## There isn't much features on the iPod at all, except games.
##My friend has this unit while not experience it much, I look at other reviews on this site and tried out the unit at Best Buy, and it's definitely the most overrated gadget in history. 
sound[+2]##SOUND QUALITY: The iPod's sound quality is pretty good.
## The Creative player sounds a bit better, but not anything to worry about.
equalizer[-1]## It has an equalizer, but the iRiver H10-20GB has a lot more presets than the iPod. 
bass[+3],treble[+2]##The bass is deep and the treble is clear.
battery[-2]##  DURABILITY: Not good. First problem, if you haven't seen the news recently, the iPods are being recalled for battery problems and not lasting the advertised 18 months.
##This is really stupid to me. 18 months for a battery isn't good, actually, it's medicore. 
##iRiver's battery lasts four to five years. 
Replaceable battery[-3]##Also, the battery's AREN'T USER REPLACEABLE.
## However, the Creative and iRiver players are (Rio's isn't), and they only cost around $30 to replace, while iPod charges shipping and technical support. 
##The iPod's battery, 1.5 years. 
##Yeah, pretty weak.
flip side[-2]## Another thing you should know, the metal on the flip side of the iPod is very tacky, and scratches very easily.
## While all MP3 players are easy to scratch, the iPod is the worst of the Creative and iRiver.
case[-2]## Also, not liking the gel case. 
##iRiver's seems a lot more sturdier than the iPod's.
features[-3]## FEATURES: Really, there aren't any features, unless you call the games a feature. 
FM tuner[-3]##There is no FM tuner, while there is no FM tuner on the Creative Zen (on the micro version of the Zen there is a tuner), the iRiver H10-20GB, the Rio Karma, and the iAudio X5 have FM tuners. 
voice recording[-3]## There is also no voice recording, something most if not all MP3 players have that the iPod doesn't.
photo viewing[-1]## There is no photo viewing option, however, there is a 20 GB photo iPod, but it costs $20 more.
## There is an alarm and timer, but most MP3 players have this feature.
use[+3]##  EASE OF USE/DESIGN: The iPod is a very easy to use MP3 player, and if you can't figure this out, you shouldn't even own one.
##The Click Wheel is a great design, something no one else came up with (however, the iRiver has a touchpad). 
iTunes[-1]##I'm probably the only person that dislikes the iTunes software. 
##I just don't like it, the weird thing is, I don't know why I dislike it.
## Maybe because it doesn't have a lot of skins to choose from like WMP, but then again, I dislike WMP as well because it's slow on my computer. 
##Anyhow, adding music to the player is easy.
## BATTERY LIFE: Pretty medicore at 12 hours, the Creative, iAudio, Rio, and iRiver players last longer. 
CUSTOMER SERVICE[-3]## CUSTOMER SERVICE: Awful. Listen to this one, remember the battery statement I made earlier. 
##If your battery dies and it's still under warranty, guess what, you're out of luck, because Apple doesn't cover the battery in the iPod warranty. 
##They have the nerve to charge you $30 for a warrantied iPod.
technical service[-3]## There technical service isn't helpful either; they just read what's on their website and charge you $50 (+ toll fees) to do it.
##At least Creative and iRiver's only charge toll fees like most companies.  
iPod[-3], sound quality[+2], design[+2]##OVERALL: I highly dislike the iPod, even though the sound quality and design is above-average. 
##Maybe in their 5th generation they'll add features to the iPod. But for now, pleases don't buy this, and buy a Creative Zen or the iRiver H10-20GB instead. 
##God Save Apple	 I have been an Apple person since 1984, when I got my first Mac. 
##Since then, I have been a devotee of the elegant styling and functionality of all things Apple. 
Ipod[+2]##The Ipod is a fine cousin to the early macs and current offerings from Jobs and Company. 
Apple[+2]##Long live Apple, long live Macs, and long live the Ipod!     
ipod[+2]##I have an ipod and it is a great buy. 
##It holds a ton of songs and looks cool in the palm of your hand.
sturdy[+2]## Very sturdy and strong.
games[-1]## Doesn't have alot of good games on it.
## the 20 gig because that holds 10,000 songs right there and that's alot of songs. 
##buy it.      
iPod[+3],service[-2]##iPod is brilliant, but service was awful
## Wow iPod. 
##How did we listen to music before it?
##This 20 gigabyte iPod by Apple Computer allows you to put up to 5000 songs onto it, in a choice of digital formats.  MP3, AAC, etc. 
iTunes[+2]##The software with the iPod includes iTunes, which allows you to play the music on your computer, rip CDs onto your computer, and move your music from the computer to the iPod. 
##iTunes is a great piece of software, and you can also buy songs from the iTunes Store at 99 cents per download. 
click wheel[+2]##This new click wheel iPod allows you to navigate through the menus and song via a touch-wheel for scrolling and click-able buttons for selection.  
##It allows fast and easy navigation.
## The backlit screen of the iPod is also easy to read. 
song quality[+3],ear buds[+3]## The song quality of the iPod is excellent, and the included ear buds are actually more than satisfactory, for most users.
scratches[-1]## The back of the iPod is in a chrome finish, and this surface is prone to scratches. 
##It is best to protect the iPod in a case of some kind.
Battery life[+1]## Battery life keeps improving on the iPod, and a new iPod will give you up to twelve hours of play time, per charge. 
##I use my iPod all the time. 
## You can also use it as an external hard drive to back-up documents, photographs, etc. 
##The problem with my iPod. 
## The first one I received skipped songs randomly. 
## I had to send it in for repair, and it took six weeks to get a replacement back to me.
## I actually had to contact Apple's Vice-president, in order to get the situation resolved.  
##However, he quickly helped me, and I have been enjoying my replacement 20 gigabyte click-wheel iPod for several months now. 
Apple[+2]##Thank you Apple!  You make fabulous products. 
product[+2]## The product I rate five stars, 
service[-2]##but I had to give you four because the service for my brand-new iPod was terribly slow.
## However, you should still buy an iPod!
## The chances of getting a flawed one is very small indeed.
Amazon[+2]##  Plus, if you order from Amazon.com, they will exchange it for you no problem.  
##I had ordered a customized one from Apple.com, so I couldn't exchange it. 
##iPod will change the way you enjoy music!      
##Very Pleased.
##I'd never had an MP3 player before, so this was a new one on me.
interface[-1]## The interface took a little getting used to.
## The best thing for anyone to do who has not used one is to ask the store clerk at apple or a teenager for advice on how to operate it. 
display[+2]## This one has a color display, which I like a lot, being very visual. 
photos[+2]##I loaded a lot of photos into it and they display very clearly for such a small screen and, very importantly, the transition from one photo to the next is instantaneous. 
sound[+1]## The sound is just fine. 
##I'm not a big audiophile, but I have no objections to how it sounds.
## I use it to listen to language tapes and to play "Earl" by the Dixie Chicks incessantly.  
adapter[+1]##It comes with an adapter to plug into the wall, which I hear is a step up from the other iPods, which require you plug it into a computer to charge it.  
##I also have been using it as a USB device, which just tickles me no end. 
##Now, I can back up what little I  keep on my computer quickly and without a fuss. 
photo quality[-1]## One caveat I have is that I understand the iPod does not save the photos in such a way that the quality of the image is preserved.
## I think its the 21st century version of the wallet with little photos.     
##Here's the TRUTH in short....	 
##This is a great device, but there are its pros and cons. 
Hard Drive[+2], affordable[+2]## Pros: Large Hard Drive for the $$-- 20GB and 40GB are both affordable. 
Screen[+2]##Decently Sized Screen-- One of the larger ones on the market at 2" 
Battery[+1]##Decent Battery-- On the average size, but the 40GB comes with a dock.  
##12 hours is about average, and it has an AC adapter in the box, with quick charge (2 hours) at probably 80%... and 4 hours for a full charge.
FireWire[+3],USB[+3]## FireWire & USB2.0-- For those fortunate enough to have FireWire400, your in for a real treat with autosync.
Design[+3]## Great Design-- Very sleek and touch wheel has still never been successfully copied (vertal ones are the only competition); and now the wheel clicks, taking away a lot of headaches from 3rd gen and very navigable in the menus. 
sound[+2],Durable[+2],compact[+1]##Good sound-- Plays very nicely, even though the stock headphones are kind of weak Durable-- not the most durable because its mostly plastic, but very compact and sturdy 
Games[+1]##Games-- not really important, but existant 
Hold[+1]##Hold Button-- suprisingly not all MP3s have this; this allows you  to have all the buttons unusable, so that you don't accidently hit something in your pocket. 
Radio Tuner[-2]## Cons: No AM/FM Radio Tuner-- Something a large number of competetors are doing
Voice Recorder[-2]##3 No Voice Recorder-- this has also become an important and popular feature that the iPod unfortunately doesn't have.
Memory Stick slots[-2],Battery[-2]## No Memory Stick slots-- Although a rare feature, it would be nice to have extra storage, not that it needs it Built-in Lithium Battery-- A huge hassle to bring this back; draining the battery once you get it helps, but removable/replaceable ones are a lot more convenient
iTunes[+1]##. iTunes-- this is a love-hate relationship program; usually people with Mac like this program than people with a PC, but depending on your computer expertise, this could be a difficult program to use, and it is required for an iPod. 
accessories[-1]##No inbox accessories-- An arm strap, belt strap, case, or anything would be nice, but nope... Moveable parts-- This makes me almost want to keep my 3rd gen over a 4th; with moveable parts, its easy to damage an iPod at a gym, so this is for more casual listeners; note the iPod Mini doesn't have moveable parts and is made of titanium.
Overall[+1]##  Comments: Overall this is still a great value, but is kind of overrated in the sense that there are beater deals on the market.
##  A lot of people go for the iPod because of its reputation, but if you honestly shop around and check out the reviews on Cnet and things like that, you can find a better 20GB HD MP3 player. 
## This is definately worth the money to have, but certain aspects of it doesn't make it the best.     
##Get an ARCHOS Gmini400 instead	 If you are doing your research and thinking whether iPod is right for you...      give the ARCHOS Gmini400 a look. 
##I returned my 20G iPod 7 months ago and got a Gmini instead.
## A sound decision and a happy customer right here!
## I look at iPod owners today and quietly feel sorry for them. :) They just didn't know about the ARCHOS gmini400. 
##The Gmini is like an iPod VIDEO, PHOTO, GAME, MUSIC, all into ONE and it is exactly the same size as the iPod...      and you can play any MP3 directly and fresh from the NET...     oh yeah, even audio books, anything!   
##It's a plug n play device, recognized as MASS STORAGE DEVICE on any windows xp computer. 
##No need to install the iTunes. 
Versatile[+2]##Versatile and stylish.	 
design[+2],capacity[+2],connection options[+2],iTunes[+2]##I had a Casio unit, which had given great service, and would have been happy to get another one, but was tempted by the iPod's sleek design, storage capacity, connection options- - firewire and USB, and its integration with iTunes.   
battery[-1]##The battery issue is superficially a concern, but any reasonable solder-jockey (such as myself :-) can pop in a new one when the time comes (based upon the plentiful info gained from a google for 'ipod battery replacement').   
controls[+2]##The controls and the menus are clearly displayed and easily fathomed  
##And it's easily connected to a Linux or FreeBSD machine for loading and unloading files, so I can also retire my ZIP drive. 
iPod[+2]## The iPod is a very nice product, which given reasonable care, should give a lot of service.      
##Still not so sure about this one...	
iPod[-1]## First, let me say that I got the 20gb iPod for Christmas, and I most likely would not have spent the $300 myself. 
## So far, in the month that I have had it, I have had to take it in for service twice.
##  This is a hassle, of course, but I'm not sure if the problems are to blame on poor construction, cold weather, or misuse by yours truly.  
battery[-2]##In addition, I do not think the battery lasts much more than eight to ten hours, and it can take four hours for a full charge.
##  Again, another hassle. 
## To be sure, I am not looking forwards to paying for the battery replacement, whenever that may come.  
##But enought of the negativity. 
quality[+2]## I have about 6 gb used on my iPod so far (well over 1000 songs), and as far as I can tell, all of them play at near-cd quality.
## Sound quality is more dependant on the quality of the original source and of the unit used to broadcast (headphones, stereo, etc).  
interface[+2], use[+3]##Other than the fact that one can't delete a file directly from the iPod, the interface is excellent and mind-numbingly simple to use.  
##Someone wrote that they haven't been able to upload songs from burned cds; I have not found this to be so. 
## I have several hundred songs from burned albums, at they all worked fine. 
iTunes[+1]## As for iTunes, I don't find it to be as good as the Windows Media Player as a computer mp3 player, but it is good enough. 
## I haven't used it to purchase any files, so I don't know about that.
##  All in all, it does what it is supposed to do with minimal frustration.
iPod[+2]## In conclusion, I gave the iPod a 4/5 because anything this expensive should would work just about flawlessly.
##  In the end, I haven't used it long enough to say that it is worth the extra money. 
##Do your research before you buy it, and especially talk to other owners.      
## i've had a beastly experience from trying to buy an ipod from circuit city. 
##when i got the ipod, i slid the box out of its sheath and the whole thing tumbled out! 
##simply put somebody had already opened the box earlier!
## the packing inside was in tatters. 
##i didnt touch the product. 
## i called circuit city and complained that they had sent me an already opened box.
## they initially told me that i would have to ship it back to them on my own cost. 
##then when i argued with them they told me that they would pick it up.
## a week passed but it was never picked up.
## the when i called they said they werent responsible for open packages because they couldnt verify it being open when i received it (why else would i want to return it if not for this? if the product was defective i would have complained so) and that if i returned it i would have to pay a 15% restocking fee!  i'm at my wits end with this company. 
##buyers BEWARE!     
##There's got to be a better solution...	  
##I bought my IPOD roughly six months ago, and I've been pretty disappointed so far.
sensitive[-2]## *The ipod is overly sensitive to just about everything and gets scratched easily. 
## You must buy some sort of protective case unless you want your ipod to look like some crazed animal with ten inch nails attacked it.  
##*	The 20 GB version doesn't actually have 20 GB, but 18.5 GB, which makes a difference of roughly 300 songs. *	
Battery[-1]##The Battery does not last 12 hours.  
##Like I said, I've had my ipod for six short months and I'd estimate the battery life to be about four hours at the most.
##  It seems to deteriorate every time I use it. 
battery[-2]## You can't change the battery, so I don't know what I'm going to do in a year or so.
volume[-1]##  *	You can't turn the volume up very high, but I think this might be for health reasons. *	
freezes[-1]##My ipod freezes occasionally, which is especially annoying when you're in the middle of a game of "brick." *
apple[-2]##If you call apple and tell them your ipod has been damaged, they charge you roughly $105.50 per minute and blame you for "abusing" your ipod.
support service[-2]## The user support service isn't too great either.  
##Buyer beware!      
iPod[+2]##Everything I Wanted! The Apple iPod has become one of the most sought-after electronic gadgets - and for good reason.
design[+2],capacity[+2],iTunes[+2]## Its sleek design, large memory capacity, compatibility with iTunes, and ease of use makes this one of the best portable digital listening devices on the market. 
capacity[+2]## Unless you have an enormous music/audio book library, the 20 GB model should have more than adequate storage capacity, with a stated ability to hold 5000 songs.  
##At an average of 14 cuts per CD, that's over 350 CD's. 
##This version does not come with a dock, although it can be added later as an accessory.  Y
##You can use it to listen to music or audio books, either downloaded via the internet or added to your music library using your CD drive.
wheel[+2], backlighting[+2],iTunes[+2]## Features: click wheel to navigate; ability to work with Windows or Mac; optional backlighting (you can have it on all the time, or have it shut off to save battery power after 5, 10, or 20 seconds); ability to download PDA info; automatic or manual download from iTunes when iPod is plugged into your computer. 
equalizer[+2]##There's even an equalizer (under "settings") that allows you to adjust the sound for acoustic, bass booster, bass reducer, classical, dance, "deep", and electronic.
accessories[+1]##  With accessories, you can make the iPod into a digital recorder, broadcast it remotely through stereo speakers using wireless technology, and play it through your car speakers using either a CD adaptor or FM stereo broadcaster. 
reformatted[-2]## The iPod comes formatted for the Mac, but within seconds of plugging it into a PC, is automatically reformatted for Windows.  (The HP version comes with Windows formatting, and takes seconds to change to Mac.) Although the iPod can be changed from one format to another, you will lose all of your music and data when doing so. 
##Both platforms work seamlessly with the iPod. 
## The box comes with iPod, ear buds, iTunes and iPod software, USB 2.0 and FireWire cables, and a home charger. 
## You  will need a computer with a six-pin FireWire or USB 2.0 port (USB 1.1 
##For Mac owners, you'll need Mac OS X 10.1.5 or later (10.3.4 or later is recommended) and your machine must have the appropriate ports built-in.
## PC users must have a processor of 500 MHZ or faster, Windows 2000 with Service Pack 4 or later or Windows XP, with the ports either built-in or expanded with a card. 
ITunes[+2]##ITunes can be downloaded from the enclosed CD or for free from the Apple site.    
##Since nothing is perfect, the iPod does have some disadvantages, such as its reliance on iTunes to download music (if you hate iTunes, don't buy an iPod!).  
##Because it is a hard drive, it has moving parts unlike other MP3 players, perhaps making it more prone to catastrophic damage.
steel backing[-2]## Its steel backing picks up fingerprints and scratches easily, not great from a cosmetic standpoint.  
device[+2][p]##All in all, this is a wonderful device.  
##About 1/2 inch thick, with the face dimensions the size of a credit card, it can be slipped in a pocket or carried easily in the han!d.
weight[-1],solid feel[+2]##  The weight is heavier than many digital players, but I like the solid feel. 
## Highly recommended for people who like to listen to music or audio books on the go.          
scratch[-2]##Holy cow! It really does scratch easily!	
## Wow... just less than 15 minutes and the back of it already has a scratch!
## So dissapointing, however I am now just gonna assume it's gonna get pretty niceley scratched over the years and I'll just have to live with it... and i will buy a case for it tomorrow... I mean heck I intended to get the case tomorow anyway but now it feels like the thing might even scratch IN THE CASE.. Other than that I am super extied about this product... I will update the review later in a few days...   
##great product with Limited Services
## I was quite happy after months of saving part of my pay-check to go to the store and finally get an iPod.
##  It was worth it, as I use it to this very day.
scratches[-2]##  The thing has survived plenty of falls with little or no damage, except the inevitable scratches.
Apple[+2]##  Apple has definately fulfilled its reputation in making quality equipment, and surprisingly wasn't as expensive as its reputation normally holds.  
##However, it fell into one of Apple's worst reputations. 
## It is very closed to services and programs outside of Apple's small (though luxiourious, admittedly) island. 
## However, they close you off from exploring the continent that is other music providers.  
##After hearing about the new Napster service for portable MP3 players, I was anxious to try it out. 
## This type of service is one that Microsoft is touting...  one where you pay a flat rate per month for unlimited music downloads. 
## So it was not any surprise that I could not try out this new type of service.  
Apple[-2]##Apple closed their island to anything that resembled Microsoft, and clearly let Napster know it could not use their products with Napster's services. 
## This has been the case with all other competing music services and Napster.  
##Why would they let anything compete with them when they are making millions from song downloads by iPod owners who have no other choice?
##  If Apple makes no attempt to at least create an equivalent type of service, they are failing to compete with the market. 
## And if they treat their customers like herding sheep, I see little reason to purchase another MP3 player with a bitten apple embroidered on it. 
Battery[+2]## Battery non-issue. 
## The iPod batteries can go through a full recharge cycle 400 times.
## If you listen to the iPod four hours per day and you get 10 hours per recharge cycle (not the full twelve specified by Apple) then the iPod will give you over 2.5 years of daily listening.
##  Apple provides a good discussion of the battery technology at www.apple.com/batteries (and this web address is noted in the iPod manual)
##  My earlier generation (15Gb) iPod lasted two years, shortened by my own inattention to the simple maintainence asked by Apple (go through at least one charging cycle per month, and don't store the iPod in a car on a summer day because high temp. is harmful to the battery's life). 
## Finally, if your battery gives out, you can use any number of reputable iPod services to swap it out for <$50 and you're good to go for another 2.5 years (or longer if battery technology improves.)  
##Ask yourself how often you've seen battery covers break on consumer electronics. 
##They wear out pretty easily when you're changing batteries every week or so. 
##Given that, I find the iPod solution reasonable: keep the case sealed and let the battery be changed by a technician once every 2-3 years. 
##No big deal.  
##You might change the battery once before the iPod is superceded by something a lot better and less expensive.
## In fact you may get a newer-better-cheaper device before you get to that point.  
iPod[+2],use[+2]##Finally, compare the iPod to other players on a cost/Gb, and also consider ease of use. 
iPod[+2]##The iPod is not overpriced compared to the market.
purchase[+2]##This is the best purchase I've made in a very long time.
## I am a total iPod addict. 
sound[+3],bass[+3]##The sound is INCREDIBLE; very clean, very wide dynamic range of bass, mids and highs, and can be very loud if I turn it up full blast.
## I have less than 3 GB worth of music, and I don't have any more music in my collection.
## I love my new iPod!     
Versatile[+2]##The Great And Versatile iPod	 I love my iPod! 
##I have wanted one for a long time, but just didn't want to spend the money.
## I wish I had a long time ago.
sound[+3],controls[+2]## The sound quality is excellent, accessing the music is easy, and the controls are generally well thought out. 
iTunes[-1]##As a Windows user, I had to install the software including drivers and iTunes on my desktop, and this is the only area where I encountered a nuisance. 
##The first install did not work correctly and would never transfer music to the iPod (but did allow me to register with Apple and load songs into iTunes). 
##Eventually I had to uninstall the whole works and reinstall it from scratch, and from then on it has worked like a dream.
iPod[+3]## I still give the iPod five stars, though, as it could have been something I did incorrectly during the install (though I did follow the onscreen prompts) so I'll give Apple the benefit of the doubt.
##  My only regret is that I bought the 20GB model, which is way too big for what I really need: I would have been better off with a smaller model of lower capacity. 
##Perhaps over time I will fill it up, but with almost 250 songs on my iPod now and less than 1GB used, I have a long way to go.
## That's the only advice I would give to someone considering an iPod purchase: you really may not really need 20GB or 40GB. 
##The iPod does come with other nifty software accoutrements, but honestly I haven't used them much as I use the iPod to listen to music while I run or on a plane. 
battery[+1]##The battery holds a charge for a very long time (maybe 15 or so hours of use) so realistically there are no real range or endurance issues associated with iPod use. 
outside finish[-2]##  My only complaint (really more of an observation) is that the outside finish of the iPod is rather delicate, so I am going to get a case for mine so it doesn't get all scratched up. 
quality of audio[+2],controls[+2],capacity[+2]##(It sure does look nice, though!)  I recommend this to any music lover anywhere: the quality of the audio is excellent, the controls and indicators rapidly become intuitive, and the storage capacity and battery life are huge!     
## Still my favorite MP3 player	 Is it overpriced ?
## Dunno, possibly but you have to ask yourself what you are neccessarily paying for, which is 20GBs worth of storage capacity, which even if all your music is in high fidelity such as 320kpbs, there is still a whole lot of room to place much music in here.
iTunes[+2]##  Using the software iTunes is relatively simple, you just plug the USB cable in, wait your machine to detect the iPod and voila, any songs listed in your iTunes library will be transfered on over to the iPod.
##  At first I primarily used it as a stand-alone portable player but it wasn't until I decided to take it in my car and use it to play back music that I truly adored this device.
## Now if you do decide to take the iPod on the road, my suggestion is to forego any purchasing of the FM Transmitter devices, unless you live out in the middle of Mississipi because frankly, you'll need a next-clear FM channel on your radio to get any sembelance of a clear signal. 
## I actually hooked up the iPod to my receivers AUX port with a Pbus connector and a Y-splitter cable, it wasn't too hard to do and now, I can listen to all my music in my car without ever having to lug around CDs again.
amplifier[+2]## And, with the iPods' full volume up, all you have to do is adjust your receivers' volume and your set, since the iPod itself acts as a strong amplifer of its' own.
proprietary[-1]##  If there were any complaints I have, they are marginal, but one is Apples' properietary set-up for music files, their incompatibility with other music services (i.e. Napster) is down right wrong.
## I mean, it would be nice if one day, iTunes can actually offer their customers a monthly service that allows iPod owners to load their iPods up with unlimited music with one set fee, as an option to the pay-99cents-a-track path.  
##Regardless though, it did set me back financially but now, I'm glad I have one.
## I go everywhere with it, on campus, in the gym and at work too !
##By far the best MP3 player I've ever used	
## This review will contain some comparisons to other MP3 players (mainly the Rio Nitrus) for interested consumers.
## If you want to know exclusively about the iPod, you'll find that here too!  RIO VS. IPOD  For Christmas I was given a Rio Nitrus (1.5 GB) and was extremely pleased with it. 
##However I looked up some consumer reviews online only to find out it had the shortest warranty of any MP3 player on the market, and was notorious for having poor customer service and completely breaking after 90 days (when the warranty expires, surprise, surprise). 
##I still have my Nitrus and stand by it so far - a month has nearly passed and it's still working flawlessly.
iPod[+2]##  However after purchasing a 20 GB iPod it's clear to see the superiority. 
iPod[+3], interface[+3], design[+3]##For a sleeker, smaller and more "average" MP3 player the Nitrus is great but the iPod blows it out of the water - the interface is great and the design is wonderful.
## It "feels" much more professional and well built - the clickable scroller, for example, is a brilliant invention and I never feel as if I'm going to perhaps break it or snap it off (as I sometimes did with the Nitrus).
##  THE CONS OF THE IPOD  There are a few advantages to the Nitrus. 
##You can transfer music from one PC to the other.
## However, with the iPod you cannot. 
##The music MUST be on your computer.
## If you plug your iPod into a PC and try to upload music/etc. it won't work.
##Someone told me that he had a 40 GB iPod, and after his computer crashed he lost his paid iTunes music files. 
##They were on his iPod, but the device would not let him upload the files onto his new computer; and after he tried, the iTunes software deleted the files from his iPod, assuming they were stolen (?). 
play WMA[-2]## Also, some other MP3 players such as the Nitrus allow you to play WMA (Windows Media Audio) files, whereas the iPod does NOT. 
##Considering the fact that just about any CD you purchase and "rip" to your hard drive will be formatted as a WMA file, iTunes version 4.5 (included with new iPod releases) contains an auto-converter that converts WMA to MP3 for iPod compatability.
## My only nitpick with this is that it sometimes doesn't work on certain files and presents error messages. 
##I had similar trouble with my Soundgarden CD - the ripped tracks continually failed to convert properly to MP3.  
##So, I downloaded another program (Switch freeware) and manually changed the WMA files to MP3, then downloaded them to the iPod.
## The problem with this is that a) it takes a LOT of time if you have many files and b) audio quality is somewhat lost (if you're an audiophile, this will bother you - frankly, I can't tell the difference).  
##Also, I don't like how when I first set up my iPod, it took me about four hours to get everything going - the new iTunes software has an exploited flaw which is that if you do not connect your iPod to your PC during installation, it will not configure the iPod, and when you later plug it into your computer the PC will recognize it as an external device rather than an actual iPod, and you will not be able to use the iTunes software until you access your device manager and change the iPod "hard drive" to a new letter.
## If this sounds confusing, just make sure you have your iPod plugged in when you install the iTunes software! 
## This seems obvious but the flaw lies herein: the instruction booklet tells users to charge their iPods 2 - 4 hours before initial use. 
##In the meantime, users will obviously begin to install their software - and since the charger takes up the underbelly of the iPod and USB connection to the computer, it's impossible to hook it up to your PC during installation without unplugging the charge adapter and actually turning the iPod on - which we're not supposed to do for 2 - 4 hours!  
##Confused yet? Don't be.
## This is really the only downside to the iPod - setting it up and downloading music. 
USING[+2]##The actual experience of USING the iPod is magnificent.
##  THE PROS  The bad ends here, because as far as I'm concerned the rest of...well...everything concering the iPod is an enormous PLUS!
design[+2]## The design, as mentioned above, is sleek, cool and trendy (and I think trendy = good, but it's always hard to tell these days). 
battery[+2]## The battery life lastes 12 hours, and charges quickly. (As mentioned above, the initial charge is a minimum of only two hours - not too long at all!) Once you've downloaded your music, you can access the tracks by artist, genre, album, composer (this comes in handy when the actual composer is different from the artist - e.g. covers of songs), etc.
## The list is endless.
## The entire database is set up flawlessly and really works well.
## I love scrolling through the menus - that may sound strange but that's how FUN using the iPod actually is!
sound quality[+3]## The!  sound quality is great. 
earphones[+1]##The included earphones are pretty good - my advice? 
##Don't apply the black cushioned protectors. 
##First of all, no one does this and it will make you stand out and look "uncool."
## Just kidding.
## But really, EVERYONE I've seen with an iPod leaves them off. 
##But unlike most fashion statements (if this could indeed be seen as one?) this concept is a logical one - the black cushions often cover up the letters on the earbuds that designate whether they're for your left or right ear.
## I had to constantly peel mine off to see which was which, so I finally just got rid of the cushions and don't even notice the difference.
use[+2]##  The ease of use of the iPod is a major attribute.
## As mentioned above, accessing songs is simultaneously easy and fun.
hard drive[+1]## With the iPod, you can also store documents and contact files (from programs such as Microsoft Outlook) when it's connected to your PC as an external hard drive. 
##This is good for the businessmen who listen to music on their commute and can rely on the iPod to even carry around some of their word documents.
## I'm sure future generations of the iPod will be able to carry much more, probably even videos.  
games[+1]##Also included in the "games" section is the great music trivia option - which tests your skill at being able to quickly place your own songs. 
##The game plays a segment of a song, and gives you a multiple-choice list wherein you have a short period of time to choose the title of the song from a list of others. 
##  What's great about this is that it's a game based on YOUR music. 
##When I first saw "music trivia quiz" I thought it was some pre-programmed elitist thing - it's not.
## It's a lot of fun and really tests your reflexes. 
##It's a good way to pass the time.
storage space[+2]##  20 GB OR 40 GB?  The pros of the 40 GB: Comes with a "dock station" and double storage space (10,000 songs).
##  Cons of the 40 GB: Much more expensive just for some extra space and a docking station, both of which you don't really need.
## Think about it for a minute - the 20 GB holds 5,000 songs: more than you're ever likely to need at any one time.
## If you want to add more, just delete some that you haven't been listening to recently.
## I mean, for music buffs and archivists - use your PC as the archive, not the iPod! 
##It's just my personal advice but you're saving a lot of money and from personal experience the docking station is really sort of a rip-off - based on the sleek design of the iPod, it's very easy to simply lay it down without damaging it or anything.
iPod[+2], capacity[+2], price[+2]##  Overall the iPod really is an almost flawless beast. The capacity in the 20 GB is more than I think most people would ever need and, for the price, I highly recommend it.
## At $290 (the price I paid) it's quite a bargain.
## My ONLY complaint thus far is the process of downloading tracks to the iPod itself - the iTunes software is really a hassle, above all else the whole concept of WMA and the faulty built-in converter
##.  But the iPod itself is totally flawless as far as I'm concerned, and the best MP3 player on the market. 
##Whether you're on the go or just want to lounge around the house listening to music, you could definitely do much, much worse than purchasing this durable and reliable product from Apple.
##Would be FIVE STARS, except for MAJOR FLAW	
## Let me say first, that I have always been a hater of all things Apple.  
##However, after holding an ipod at circuit city, I knew I had to have one.  
##When I finally got it, I was amazed by how asthetically pleasing everything was, including the packaging. 
## The ipod itself is very pleasing to hold with its smooth surfaces.
##  The only thing that protrudes slightly is the "hold" switch. 
## For this reason, it is very easy to drop.  
##One of the other reviewers said get the neoprene case from marware, which is great advice.
##  I have almost dropped the ipod several times, just because it is so smooth.  
Itunes[+2][u],Design[+2][u]##Everything else about the ipod is great, the click wheel is very easy to use and so is the software that comes with it.
## To adjust the volume, you just sweep your finger lightly along the click  wheel. 
## Organizing music is a breeze too.  
## You can put songs in multiple categories, which is great.!
Finding[+2][u]##Finding all the albums, songs etc is much easier than you would think it would be even if you have 20 gig (well 18 gig) worth of music.
sounds[+3]##  It all sounds great too. 
headphones[-3]## As with most headphones that come with any type of music player,I recommend throwing these into the nearest river, unless you like having hard, round pieces of plastic in your ears. 
## I recommend Shures (shure.com). 
## I have the e3c's, and man does everything on the ipod sound great.   
store[+2]## You can even use the ipod to store files from your pc and export your outlook files to it.
##  I use a great free program called ipod agent to do this. 
## The outlook is a little clunky to use on the ipod, but it is functional. 
##   I LOVE THIS IPOD!  So why, you ask, did I give it only one star?  
BATTERY[-3]##Because Steve Jobs is a twisted individual and he made sure that he ruined this device by giving it an UNREPLACABLE 18 MONTH BATTERY. 
## To see a great little short film about this, go to ipodsdirtysecret.com  ##Basically, this is a disposable device, the idea being that when the battery goes out, you will buy the latest model of ipod.
batteries[-3]##  This was obviously a conspiracy as it is FREAKIN' EASY to manufacture a device with replaceable batteries!!
##    If you can get past this little flaw, give the ipod 5 stars, because everything else about it is pretty much perfect.  
pay[-3]##However, in my mind, $299 is a lot to pay for a device that will only last 18 MONTHS. 
## Hence, the one star rating...     
##Good, But Not For Everyone
## I was shopping for a MP3 player recently, and had the opportunity to play with my cousin's 20GB iPod at some length to see how I liked it.
## I had initially been planning on buying this or another Apple product, but since decided to buy a player made by a different manufacturer.
##  Overall, I think the iPod is a good player, although I would note some features that turned me off: 
interface[-2]## LOOKS AND DURABILITY: I realize many people are fond of the minimalist white interface.  
## I'm not one of them.
##  While I like the minimialism of the player, I try to avoid plastic products made of white- they tend to yellow with age. 
##While they have released those "tattoos" for the players, I think those just look cheap and gaudy, especially since they leave the corners of the iPod exposed.  
scratches[-2]##The biggest red flag for me was the fact that although my cousin's player was relatively new, it was riddled with scratches.
##  While he's not the most careful guy in the world, it was really beat up consider the minimal amount he uses the thing, and talking to other people who have iPods confirmed that the player scratches very easily- and from personal experience, they look terrible scratched up.  
##THE CLICKWHEEL: Again, I realize that most people think this is the greatest thing since sliced bread. 
## I disagree. 
## I strongly suggest anyone considering an iPod test it out first to see how they like it. 
## I thought the clickwheel sounded great, but after trying it found it awkward.  
##As a student, I spend a significant amount of time on my laptop and am used to scrolling up and down on the touchpad, which made the Creative Zen Touch a more attractive product for me. 
## Be sure you test this first to see if it does feel intuitive for you, rather than just going on the fact that it does sound pretty neat. 
BATTERY[-3]## BATTERY: Compared to the other players on the market, the iPod has one of the worst batteries around.
## The Sony Walkman and Creative Zen Touch get 30 and 24 hours per charge, respe
## Since no company has yet to come out with an interchangeable battery for the jukebox-sized players (the Creative Labs Zen Micro is the only one I'm aware of that has this, and it's 5 GB), this can be an issue.  
##IN SUMMARY: This is a good, basic player.  It's not for everyone, and if you're in the market for one I suggest that you try to put aside the huge popularity of the iPod and look harshly at the actual features that the other players on the market have, and see how they stack up. 
## Apple is already being outpaced by Creative Labs and Sony on the battery front, and just about any non-Apple player allows you more compatibility with download services than Apple's iTunes-only program.
##  But since a lot of these MP3 players are marketed on aesthetics, do go to your local store or borrow a friend's and see how the product actually feels and works.
##  This may be the player for you, but it's not leaps and bounds ahead of any other player, and others are ahead of it in certain areas, so practice some caution when you buy.     
##	Pure And Simple, Wonderful Stuff.
iPod[+2]##	 If, like me you simply want an iPod to play your mp3's, buy this one. 
##If you want colour screens, photos, videos etc, buy the latest (extremely expensive) model, I think the new 60GB has all the extras. 
##This 20GB just plays the songs, most people won't even use the 20GB space, I've got about 1500 songs on mine that adds up to nearly 13GB.
##  I would strongly recommend the iPod over rival mp3 players such as the Creative Zen and the creatively named iRiver. 
##Most importantly because the iPods warranty is far superior to both these, the Creative Zens is only 90 days, way too short. 
##The iRivers is also short, and lets face it, what is more likely to brake or go wrong, the Apple iPod or Creative Zen, iRiver. 
##Both from unspecialist makes, and in Creatives case a company that deals mostly in computer parts, and has not invested the money that Apple has. 
reliability[+2]##So reliability is the winner here for the iPod.
##  As far as an actual player is concerned, the iPod is next to none.
## The one advantage the iRiver has is it can play wma files aswell as mp3s, unlike the iPod. 
##But all you need to do is convert the files (besides mp3s are larger and better quality files than wmas) using a wide range of convertors, my favourite is the dBPowerAmp Music Coverter which also allows you to burn directly from cd to hardrive in mp3 format unlike Media Player.
## It's well worth it, the mp3s do in fact sound better.  
looks[+2]##For looks, well iPod is head and shoulders better, both the iRiver and Creative Zen look positively ugly when next to a gleaming iPod. 
package[+2]## The iPod package comes with everything you need, the AC adaptor, firewire cable (quicker than USB, but slower than USB 2 which it also gives), those snazzy and powerfull headphones, and of course the player. 
## Quite simply, BUY THE IPOD, whatever size you wish. 
##I would go along the lines of any more than 2 thousands songs, get a larger size such as the 40GB, just to be on the safe side.
##Just don't drop it.
## I had the 15G iPod of the previous incarnation. 
## Actually I had two: the first one stopped working within a month so I took it back, and they exchanged it (which is evidently pretty extraordinary - guess I lucked out.  I didn't tell them I had dropped it once). 
## Then I had the second one in my boyfriend's car, and his car got jacked.  
##Fortunately his insurance covered it (also extraordinary), and as luck would have it, this new gen of iPods came out the same week he got the check.
##  So I got a free 5G upgrade out of that misfortune.
##  I also got to see just how utterly addicted I am to my iPod in the few weeks I had to go without one.
##  The major change from the previous model, other than the extra 5G for the same price, is that this one is slightly smaller and lighter, and the already minimal buttons (menu, play/pause, forward and back) have now been assigned to the four quarters of the click wheel, so that even less brain power is required to search through your 10,000 stolen mp3s. 
## Mac is really big on streamlining everything (maybe that's why you never get a decent manual with any of their products). 
## I like the click wheel OK, but actually the one problem I've had with this, my third, iPod is that occassionally the wheel gets "stuck," meaning either it won't respond at all, or it "jumps" down playlists uncontrollably. 
## When this happens I have to toggle the lock switch on and off to get it to work properly.
##I guess that's a pretty minor deal, but it can be annoying. 
## Needless to say, these are fragile machines.
design[-2]## Maybe this new design is more durable than the last, but I kind of doubt it.  
##I don't really intend to drop mine to find out. 
## The thing is, naturally you're going to use your iPod at the gym or whatever, and it can be a bit of a liability because you always feel like you have to protect it.
## Not that anybody would revert back to their old-skool walkman just because you can knock it around more.  
##The thousands of songs at your fingertips thing, you just can't beat that with a stick.  
##But seriously though, how bout we work on the durability thing for the next gen.
scratch[-2]## We can start by losing the shiny miracle-material cover that you can literally scratch just by looking at it wrong, and thus eliminate the need for third-party "iSkin" protective covers for an extra thirty bucks.
## The other thing is the earbuds.  
earbuds[-2][p]##First of all, I've never been big on earbuds - they're just not that comfortable.
##  These are nice ones, and you get great sound at first, but again, they break if you even think mean things about them. 
## With both pairs I had ceramic rattling in my ears by month two. 
## And I'm really not that rough with things! 
iPod[+2]## These issues aside, the iPod is kind of like the cell phone in that once you have one, you can't be without one.
##  Mac has at least cornered the mp3 player market across the board.
##  PC users have a lot of choices, but based on what I've heard and read, the iPod really is the best all-around, athough being a Mac product, it has the usual streamlined and comparatively less customizable software.
alternative[-1]##  And if you're a Mac user like me, they've naturally made sure you have no viable alternative.  
iTunes[+1]##Also, you have to use it with iTunes - or they'll sue, dammit!  But iTunes is about as good as anything. 
##  Buy the 20GB instead of the Mini	 
##A lot of the reviews I've read talk about IPODS in general.
## I'm writing about the 4G IPOD 20GB model.
## I ordered the mini from amazon, and while waiting for it to arrive I wandered into the Apple store.  
##I'm glad I did.
##  After talking to the salesman, I instead bought the 4G, 20GB (that stands for 4th generation; it looks like a mini - same features), and didn't know that a lot of the ipods out there for sell, including on amazon, are still 3G.
player[+2][p]## The player is great. 
## I didn't think I would need more than the 5GB that the mini has, but... once I downloaded a few audio books on top of my CD's -- I'm GLAD I have the extra memory.
battery [-1]## However, the battery life isn't as good as I would like. 
##There is an attachment you can buy that allows you to use AA batteries in an emergency, but...I've never completely run out of juice; just dangerously low on long airline trips. 
## For about $5! 6 dollars, you can get an "extended warranty" and apple will replace the battery within 2 years if it dies.
##  Think about that if you are worried about battery life. 
product[+2]## Overall, this product is AWESOME. 
features[+2]## All the "cool" features of the mini, but with 20GB instead of 5.  
##I love it.
##I like it.	
## Pros Holds a ton of music. 
##No more Cds and your cd player getting broken when you step on it in your car or any other place 
use[+2]## Really easy to use.
click wheel[+2]## Has the click wheel and the ability to scan through thousnds of songs and organizes them great.
helpline[+2]## Has a great helpline.
USB[+2},charger[+1]## They fix the problem and help you with whatever your I-Pod needs Comes with two USB ports and a charger.
I-Tunes[+1]## They are EXTREMELY convient and you don't have to buy them seperately Has I-Tunes, which provides qulity music at low prices.
Breaks[-2]##  Cons Breaks easily. 
Hard drive[-1]##Hard drive screws up occasionally
## Warranty expires only after a year.
## Is extremely senstive to bumps and knocks.  
I-Pod[+2]##The I-Pod is the best thing I have ever used. 
##I have a ton of cds and I make a mess trying to organize them into things.
## The I-Pod certainly helps me with my music and I can take it anywhere with me.
## I can take it to Work, School, and even listen to it at my computer. 
##Also, a word of warning, hide the White Earbud headphones, because they are the most noticable earphones ever and your precious I-Pod could be stolen from you if you don't take steps to hide it from view of other people. 
##I hope you enjoy your I-Pod!     
##So far it has worked out great	 I
## held out for the 4th generation 20GB iPod when I heard that it was coming equiped with the 'click wheel', that had previously only been available for the iPod 'mini'. 
use[+2]##I found that to be the most impressive thing about the iPod 'mini' - basically for ease of use, and the feel it gives. 
##It was worth the wait.
##   The 'click wheel' is much easier to use, compared to the previous generation's models with the touch screen. 
##It takes seconds to work the menus and go from song to song.  
USB[+1],firewire[+1]## This unit comes with the USB/firewire cable as a standard item now. 
##Does not come with the dock, remote control, or carrying case like the 3rd generation units - but you get $100 off the price, so you can still end up with the same accessories, and a new generation iPod for the same money.
use[+2]##  I have transferred in about 2,400 tracks so far - very easy to use both the Ipod and iTunes. 
##Both are EXTREMELY user friendly and take minutes to get used to.
##   Backing up your iTunes library takes a short amount of time. 
##Two DVDs to capture all 2,400 tracks. 
##Burning CDs from iTunes is much easier than the Windows Media Player, which I was previously using.   
##The first battery charge lasted only about six hours. 
##That may be due to the fact that I used the menus a lot, and had it hooked up to the Griffin iTrip (The iTrip works great) for most of that time.
## The second battery charge lasted over twelve hours.
## I used it mainly on shuffle play and shut off the "click" sound to get this much life out of it.   
sound quality[+2]##I was worried about what the sound quality would be like, but that seems to be just as good as the actual CD sound.
## I bought the JBL Creature speakers for home use, and they work great with the iPod. 
##Match them pretty well to boot.  
## The only area I wish Apple had improved upon would be the screen.
## It is sharper on the 'mini' units. 
screen[-1]##This is only a problem at night, during the day the screen is very easy to see. 
##The backlight helps out at night, but can be a drain on the battery. 
##You can adjust the time the backlight stays on (or turn it off completely), so it's only a minor issue.  
## The first time I took it in the car, and was able to chose from hundreds of CD titles, thousands of songs, to have all of that at my fingertips was a great experience.
## Talk about convenience.
## I would strongly recommend you get one !!     
##I Love My iPod!
## Although iPods have been around for a few years, they didn't really get hot until now. 
##I ended up (surprisingly) getting one for Christmas. 
features[+2]##I love the features on the iPod and the many things you can do with it. 
##It DESERVES a perfect 5-stars.
battery[-2]## The only problem is the battery life.
## After about 3-4 months, you see your battery draining faster than it should. 
##After a year, your battery is dead and you need to replace it with a new one. 
battery[-2]##Apple's iPod battery replacement service costs $100! 
##Amazing.
## You pay $300 for the iPod itself, then $100 to get the battery fixed. 
##If you look on Google or around the web's many search engines, you can find a site that will replace the battery at a cheaper price. 
##Apple needs to step it up and get better, longer lasting batteries.     
##Not perfect, but I'm still enamored...	 I've had an iRiver MP3 player for a year or so now, and it's really great for listening to the radio. 
## It's small and lightweight, but it has very little storage space and the shape is clunky.
## I set my sights on this super sexy iPod and didn't stop until I finally had one in my hands. 
## I am so in love with this thing I can hardly stand it.   
## It's got LOTS of pros, and a couple minor cons, which I will outline below.  
##It's still an absolutely unbeatable value for the amazing technology you're getting, so don't let a few petty cons dissaude you from owning THE coolest thing on the planet right now for any music lover. 
## The iPod is a little more weighty than I expected, but it's not unmanageable.  
arm band[+2]##The arm band is fantastic and it doesn't budge even at the gym.  
design[+2]##I love the slim design; the weight would only be an issue if it were bulky.  
sound[+3]##The ear buds that come with it look cheap, but the sound quality is amazing. 
## It sounds 10 times better if you use the little black foam cushions that slip over the buds.
click wheel[+2]##  The click wheel is incredibly convenient, however it can be a little overly touchy at times, which will make you frustrated with your own fingers.  
##A lot of this has to do with being so excited when you first get it that you get beside yourself and have to force yourself to slow down.  ;)  I love the shuffle function, which virtually eliminates the need to touch it at all.
##  I use mine mostly at the gym, so this is fantastic for me.
##  It charges quickly and holds a charge for a very long time.  
##I love that it allows you to stop and turn it off in the middle of a song if need be, and when you power it back on it will continue right where you left off! 
iTunes[+2]## I am a big fan of iTunes, simply because it is terribly fast and convenient - IF you are buying the songs from the iTunes site.  
##However, I have found that converting my CD's and MP3's into the iTunes library fo!r upload takes a fairly annoying chunck of time.
##  It's the biggest pain in the rear end of all the cons, without a doubt.
##  Of course, once the songs are converted, you don't have to worry with them again.
##  It's very fast and easy to create custom playlists for upload.   
## The only other problem I have noticed is that on some uploads it will switch around CD song titles (all on the same artist, it just mixes up the titles). 
## I have no clue why this happens, as they show up perfectly in my iTunes library and there was no interruption during the uploads. 
## It's really no big deal to me, but is worth mentioning. 
## All in all, the good far outweighs the bad. 
## This is the first line of Apple products I have owned (we also have an iPod mini and are about to purchase a shuffle).
##  I am so impressed with the iPod that our next purchase will likely be a Mini Mac. 
Apple[+2]## Way to go Apple!  
##You've earned a new fan.     
##Product Of The Decade	
## What was the biggest must-have item of 2004?
## Yep, the iPod. 
##Sales of Apple's mini-phenomenon currently stand at around 20 million worldwide, and this number is set to triple over the next couple of years. 
##That's a lot of money Apple are making from a very powerful, influential and trendy product.
## But is it worth all the hype? 
##Well reviewing a product like this is definitely complicated, because do I rate my personal connotation on it? 
##Or simply rate its performance in relation to other products? 
##There's no two ways about it, I have been less than impressed with my own iPod 20 GB when it arrived two weeks ago.
## However, having said that, this could just be because I haven't really had enough time to experience it in its entirety.  
iPod[+2]##I rarely get drawn in by mass-commercialism, but something about the iPod made me say, in the words of Lou and Andy, "I WANT THAT ONE!" I was willing to shell out 
[t]
##The world of MP3 players is blinding, and since most people don't understand the technology [myself included], user-friendliness is EXTREMELY IMPORTANT. 
instruction[-2] ##Unfortunately, Creative offered scant few pages of instruction, which meant that I was on own from the outset. 
touch-pad[-2], navigate[-3] ##After attempting to navigate the clumsy touch-pad system, I could not get the unit to download my wma files. 
##When most of us purchase these little devises, we do so because of their diminuitive size and extraordinary storage capacities. 
EXPLAIN[-3] ##SO, YOU MIGHT INQUIRE, WHY DON'T THEY MAKE IT A FIRST PRIORITY TO CAREFULLY, SIMPLY EXPLAIN HOW DOWNLOAD MUSIC FROM YOUR MUSIC LIBRARY TO THEIR DEVICE??? This seems academic to me.
navigating[-3] ##Most of us just want to plug and play, not spend a year navigating a maze of complicated options...like transfering everything on a hard drive to this stupid thing.
##I don't care what ELSE it can do.
##I just want MUSIC to eminate from it when I want, how I want.
sound[+2] ##All of this said [as it's on it's way back to Amazon], the one song it did include provided far better sound than the IPOD. 
bass[+2],highs[+2} ##The base was deeper and the highs were crisper. 
touch-pad[-3], instruction[-3] ##Unfortunately, the touch-pad issues [non-intuitive] and poor instruction guide killed it. 
[t]
##Why get locked in to crappy Itunes weather you want to or not? 
machine[+3] ##what a kick butt Mp3 machine and the freedom to get songs from a reasonable source, instead of paying for them two or three times, then get the Creative Zen IPOD killer, kiss my ass Itunes!
##i got 6000 mp3's you'll never register or gay up.     
[t]
##Two days after writing this review below, I want to remove another two stars. 
##I just discovered another con in my list of pros and cons.
Zen Micro[-2] ##This one is particularly bothersome: Allegedly one can use the Zen Micro as a portable drive to store and transport data from one computer to another.
##Ahhh! There is a catch, the manufacturer does not tell you. 
store[+2], INSTALL[-2] ##Although you can store any type of file on the Zen Micro to download onto a different computer, you need to INSTALL (on the computer you are moving the data to) Zen Micro software and drivers to do it!!! 
##I just tried to move a load of plain data files from my home computer to my office work computer, and it is promting me to install Zen Micro software, etc.... 
##I have used similar devices and they are seamless and simple. 
software[-2] ##Who wants to go through the hassles of loading software onto a "foreign" computer just to move over some simple (*.txt) files?  
##This brings my review to one star! 
##But Amazon won't allow me to reduce the number of stars once I have already established three two days ago.  
sound[+3], portability[+2] ##The sound is great, the portability, etc... all the "stuff" you expect from a good MP-3 player, this Zen Micro has it. 
##It COULD have been a great product. 
##Why isn't it? 
##Read the next six mixed pros and cons: .  
##1.
Button sensitivity[-2] ##) Button sensitivity: Even reduced to the lowest sensitivity setting, the buttons are far two sensitive, really takes some getting use to, and even then, it is still too sensitive. 
##The company has received thousands of complaints about this and refuses to do anything about it. . 
##2.
FEATURE[-3], recharge cord[-3] ##) WORST FEATURE POSSIBLE, THIS ALONE MAKES IT RATE ONE STAR: What's up with no recharge cord? 
cost[-3]##You have to purchase that separately for some outrageous cost. 
##If you want to recharge it, you MUST connect it to your computer. 
##The recharge cord will do the job in a fraction of the time that the USB cable will hooked to your computer. 
charged[-2] ##I took my Zen Micro with me over the weekend, and was forced to lug my laptop with me on the trip for one reason: to keep the Zen Micro charged. 
##Infuriating! Nearly all other MP-3 producing companies include a recharging cord with their product that can be plugged into a wall socket. 
##If you want a wall-socket recharging cord, you have to dish out somewhere between $30 and $35, plus shipping and handling, for a cord that cost less than $1 to manufacture and market. 
product[-2] ##I have trashed this product on other opinion sites based on this major flaw alone. 
##What is up with nickle and dimeing consumers on the recharge cord? 
##Buy from another company and run from Creative, Inc. 
##Their product may appear more enconomical, but it isn't in the long run. . 
##3.
prices[-3] ##) Creative, Inc. the maker includes the barest of the bare minimum in the box, then through gross profiteering nickles and dimes you on EVERY single accessory at extraordinarily inflated prices. 
case[-2] ##The box included a little polyester, pull-string BAG, (yes, you read right a BAG, something a boy would carry ten marbles in) and tries to pass it off as the case. 
case[-2] ##If you want to purchase a real case or container or clip-on carrier for you Zen Micro, expect to purchase it separately and to dish out big time. . 
##4.
battery[+3] ##) One outstanding positive feature is the battery. It holds a charge for a long time, longer than most other similar products and the user can replace it easily or take another along as a backup. 
##Some other companies require you to send your player back and then charge you an additional $130 to replace their batteries. 
rechargeable battery[+3] ##Creative did well on its rechargeable battery feature. .
##5.
##) I purchased this device primarily to record off the built-in FM receiver for lectures and seminars that are broadcast live over a FM signal for the hearing impaired. 
FM receiver[+1] ##The Zen Micro FM receiver is ok, not great. 
FM receiver[-][cc] ##IRiver has a better FM receiver built in, but the drawback to IRiver products is they are flimsy and poorly constructed. 
##I have gone through two of them in two years. . 
##6.
constructed[+3][u] ##) The Zen Micro appears sturdy and well constructed, hefty, if you will, far better than many of its competitors. . 
charges[-2] ##As I wrote, this COULD have been a great product, but expect hidden charges (read gross profiteering and price gouging) as the company royally sticks you on every conceivable accessory necessary for normal daily usage.     
[t]
Zen Micro[+2] ##Well, I have an Ipod mini - and I really like it, but all in all, I like the Zen Micro more.
##  Why?  
size[+2], space[+2][u], battery[+2], look[+2]##Smaller size, 1 gb of more space, radio, voice recording, removable battery, cooler look, all in one.  
touchpad[-1] ##The touchpad is annoying sometimes (give me the click-wheel and pressable buttons any day), but not at all as difficult to get over as other people are saying.
small[+3] ##I love how small the thing is, and the blue glow - I've had it for two weeks with no electronic problems at all.  
Media Source[+2], file transfers[+3] ##Creative Media Source is very easy to use once you get the hang of it, and the file transfers are fast.  
Sound[+2], fm tuner[+2], recorder[+2] ##Sound quality is great, fm tuner is fine, as is the recorder.  
player[+2] ##This is the mp3 player with everything I need.  As long as it lasts me a good three years, I'm satisfied.        
[t]
##I am one of the many people who (a) are PC Based and (b) can't stand to see the multitudes of people with those funky white headphones that belong to Ipod users. ##I first want to say that I think Apple is making the same old mistake as they did with Macintosh years ago. 
##This proprietory software to download. 
##(That was a major turn off). 
##I am the type of person that will always go against the masses of blind followers so there was no way I was getting an Ipod. 
player[+2][p] ##Also If you want a device that does soo much more than the Ipod mini but is at the same price, this is the player for you. 
##The reason why I didn't give the Zen Micro 5 stars is that they also seem to want to conform the the Ipod sense of style. 
Headphones[-2] ##and supply those stupid white Headphones. 
##I also think that if you are going to offer them in different colors then commit all the way and have the entire device in that color, not just the front and color the head phones as well. 
##Let's face it. 
##Apple is Apple. 
##So Creative should be "Creative". 
[t]
##I've been looking for a portable MP3 player for awhile now. 
##With so many choices it was a tough decision. 
##My first instinct was to go with an iPod. 
##I visited quite a few forums and while the iPod is a great player I was concerned with the battery life and the inability to change them without breaking open the case.  
##I started looking at the Creative Zen Micro and after reading numerous reviews from message boards and magazines I decided I'd give the Zen a try. 
##All I can say is what a wonderful choice! 
##I ordered from Amazon and got the Limited Edition package that includes a free battery!  
small[+3][u] ##Upon opening the box I was confronted with this small cute little MP3 player. 
##I popped one of the batteries in and to my surprised it started right up. 
installation[+3] ##The software included is an easy installation and you have the option of using the Creative software, Windows Media Player 10, or simply Windows Explorer to move music back and forth between your Zen Touch. 
##I did a quick test by selecting a few files and copying them over and they loaded right in. 
##Pressed play and I was off. 
touch pad[-1] ##The touch pad does take a little getting used to. 
##I'm still trying to manage the thing myself, but I've found that if you put the sensitivity to low it is fine.  
cable[+1],adapter[+1],headphones[+1], stand[+1],pouch[+1]##The package also comes with a USB cable, an AC adapter, a pair of headphones (they're okay until you get a better pair), a stand, and a microfiber pouch to carry your Zen Touch in.  
Zen Touch[+3][u] ##Overall I'm incredibly impressed with my new Zen Touch. 
looks[+3] ##It's cute as anything and the glowing blue LED looks super cool around the edges. 
player[+2] ##For the price I think this is a remarkably fun MP3 player.
##Enjoy!     
[t]
player[+3][p] ##I've had this player for more than 4 months and I'm very happy with it. 
##I use it on an average 5 hours a day I hook it up to my Belkin FM transmitter in the car or to my Logitech 2.
Speakers[+2] ##1 Speakers at home, I rarely use it with the earbuds, though they are much better than the ones you normally get with other mp3 players.  
Look[+3], Feel[+3] ##The Look & Feel: I have the black one and the contrasting neon blue on the buttons add a very nice ambience. 
##The light pulsates when you are charging it almost as if it were breathing. 
tiny[-1][u], back[+3] ##The player itself is tiny , it gets a bit bulky when you put it in the hardcase, which you need to do if you don't want to get scrathes on the back(its a nice looking back too ). 
feels[+2][p] ##It feels tiny in the hand without it. 
stand[+2] ##The stand that comes with it is very useful to prop it up on the desk. 
##The belt clip however is not very useful if you move around a lot. 
looks[+3], read[+2][u] ##The blue backlit LCD looks really neat and is easy to read. 
touch controls[-1] ##The touch controls took a little getting used to but now I wouldn't change it for the scroll wheel. 
touch buttons[+3] ##The touch buttons are textured so that your finger sdon't slip which was very thoughtful.   
Build[+3] ##Reliability & Build  I dropped the player once from about 4 ft, and it fell hard, but kept on playing. 
hardcase[+1] ##The hardcase they give with it must work well.  
solid[+2][p] ##It feels solid and not flimsy like the carbon.  
sound[+3] ##Sound  I'm no audiophile but I was amazed by the clarity the player had, it was much better than the sound card on my Computer and louder too. 
sound[+3] ##I have had the ipod mini and it performs on the level with my sound card but the micro beats it outright.  
sound[+3] ##Best of all the WMAs(I have a lot of them) sound great.  
features[+3] ##Utility Its got a huge list of features including an FM Recorder a Calender and contacts list. 
##Its not convinient to enter name of course but synchronise it with outlook and it becomes a gem of a address book. 
recorded[+3] ##The songs recorded with FM are as good as the original signal. 
##The interface takes 2 secs after you press record to show up but its actually started recording at the moment you press record.  
software[-1] ##Software The software that comes along with it is not very intuitive but once you are used to it,it  does the job well. 
playlists[+3] ##Creating and modifying playlists is easy and clean.  
battery life[-2] ##There are 2 things that need fixing  First is the battery life. It will run for 6 hrs without problems with medium usage of the buttons. 
USB[-2] ##Second might be a problem I might have with my PC but not too sure, when the player is connected on the USB and I start playing on it and also using the windows explorer, it sometimes pauses by itself and tries to synchronise with the PC during play, which is a bit irritating.     
[t]
creative zen[+2] ##I think that for its price compared to the ipod the creative zen is pretty good.  
##i have a lot of files in wma so that was the biggest factor in my decision to purchase the zen.  
headphone jack[-3] ##HOWEVER after just one month my headphone jack was BROKEN as a result of normal, every-day use.  
##by broken i mean that it would no longer transmit sound.  
support[+3] ##The good news is that the creative support is very responsive and after some emails and postal exchanges, i had a new zen.  
##i havent used it much yet so i dont know if i will have the same problem; obviously i hope not.  
organization[-2][u] ##i dont especially like how music files are unstructured; basically they are just dumped into one folder with no organization, like you might have in windows explorer folders and subfolders.  
##in principle playlists, album names, artist names, etc would help you organize but this only works IF your tracks have all the necessary data; mine do not.  
##and if you have 2500 songs, as you might very well, you will be reluctant to edit the clip properties of 2500 files.  
sound[+1] ##the sound is quite good, in terms of volume.  
headphones[-2] ##the headphones are not very comfortable, but most people have a certain style they like so just go buy new ones or keep the ones you have.  
installation[+2], touch pad[+1] ##i didnt have any installation problems; and the touch pad is fine, even if it is sort of inaccurate.  
##you just get used to it after a while.  
cheaper[+2][u],WMA files[+2][u] ##i didnt get ipod because i dont especially like itunes (no music i want, but thats just me) and the creative product was cheaper; and i needed to be able to use WMA files.  
price[+2][p] ##all-in-all, its good enough for its price as long as it doesnt break again due to normal use.       
[t]
##This is a difficult player to review because I would recommend it on a case-by-case basis. 
##If you're not computer savvy or if you want things as simple as they can be, get the iPod. 
##Bottom line.  
##However, since you're reading this review, you want to avoid getting an iPod. 
##For whatever reason. There is also a low number of people, like me, who love iTunes but want to get the Zen Micro. 
##I'll talk more about that later.  
##First of all, why does every single piece of media library software that comes with an MP3 player suck? 
##(iTunes being an exception of course). 
software[-2], feature[-2][u] ##The Creative MediaSource software that comes with the Zen Micro is cluttered, and excludes my favorite feature in iTunes, the ability to automatically copy everything you import into a certain folder. 
##I like to keep all of my Mp3s in one folder and manually doing this is a pain. 
##Bottomline, don't even bother with the software that comes with the Zen Micro.  
Player[-1] ##NAGATIVES of the Player itself:  You need to do a little work before having full enjoyement of this player.  
##1.
##Set the sensitivity of the touch pad to LOW. 
##Also, as soon as you select a song and set your desired volume level, put the player on HOLD. 
sensitivy[-1] ##Even on the LOW sensitivy level, a slight touch can skip or pause the track.  
##2. 
##Update the firmware which can be found on the Creative web site. 
player[-2]##This fixes some glitches such as the player freezing.    
##POSITIVES:  Reasons for getting the Zen Micro instead of the iPod:  1. 
battery[+2] ##The battery is removable. 
##You can buy a new battery for 49.99. 
##With the iPod, if the battery has reached it's life span (after about a year), and you didn't buy the warranty from the store, you need to buy a NEW player.
## 2. ##
FM radio[+1] ## FM radio built in (Howard Stern).  
##3. 
microphone[+1] ##Record memos using the built in microphone.  
##4.
looks[+2] ##The player looks SO much better when you're actually holding it. 
##The photos don't do it justice. 
back[+2] ##The back of the player is nice too, with water ripples inside the clear white coating.  
##5. 
storage[+2] ##You can use it as a storage Hard Drive.    
##Now, about the iTunes. 
iTunes[+1] ##I have no problem using iTunes with the Zen Micro (in a makeshift sorta way).   
##This is what I do:  I copy all the music I want to import to the Zen Micro into an iTunes play list. 
##After that, you connect your Zen Micro and open My Computer. 
##Click on "Zen Micro Media Explorer" and then click on "Transfer Data Between PC and Device" after that, a File Explorer window opens. 
##And all you do is select all the tracks in the iTunes playlist and drag them to the File Explorer window.  
##It's not as seamless as if you were to use an iPod, but it only takes a few seconds longer. 
##So yeah, you can have the best of both worlds.  
##* Of Course, if you've BOUGHT tracks from iTunes, this won't work. 
##You can only copy songs you've downloaded for free or ripped from a CD.  
##**I honestly don't see the point of buying songs from iTunes when there are so many free alternatives. 
##But if you get that "fuzzy legal feeling" from paying for songs, at least buy them from allofmp3.com, there are no restrictions and the songs cost pennies.     
[t]
##I'm addicted to music. 
##I'm also somewhat of an audiophile. 
##Mp3 players are like a blessing and a curse for people like me. 
##On the one hand, you have the ability to store and plays over 1000 songs on one little piece of machine. 
##On the other hand, you get terrible sound quality. 
##I decided to go with the convienence factor and purchase a creative zen micro. 
##I was at [random electronic store], browsing through players, and came across two that made the cut. 
##The first was an ipod 5gb (I could kick myself for not buying it), and the other was a creative 5gb. 
##The creative came with a free trial of [random file sharing company] "to go". 
##So that's the one I bought. 
##Too bad.  
made[-3][u] ##First thing I noticed was that the creative wasn't well made. 
player[-3]##One drop from a pocket or desktop, and it'd be a goner.  
sound[-3] ## Problems with the sound quality were evident right away, but even I couldn't imagine they'd be that bad. 
eq[-3], bass[-3] ##The eq is awful, and even at top volumes, the bass is flat sounding. 
volume [-1] ##Cranking the master volume level up past the mark of the bar only leads to distortion and compromised sound quality. 
headphone jack[-3] ##The headphone jack gave out after only a couple weeks of use, and the stock earbuds were replaced same day with some high end sony's I'd been having. 
##They didn't really make any difference. 
##I also experimented with an adapter for the car. 
sound[-2] ##If you've been listening to cd's in your car for awhile, dealing with the drop-off in sound quality may take some getting used to. 
car adapter[+2] ##However, if there was one thing I liked about the creative, it would be the car adapter. 
##Hands down, better quality than ipod's. 
##that isn't saying much, but hey, I like to be positive.   
storage[-2][u] ##Even after all the nightmare sound problems, I'd still half-way like this product if it kept it's promise; the ability to store 1500 songs. 
storage[-2][u] ##I got about 700 loaded up before it told me I was full, and at that point, I was ready to toss it out the window.   
##If you do not care about sound/music quality in the least, and don't mind the ability to store 800 songs less than promised, get the creative zen micro.   ##Otherwise, you should get an ipod. 
creative[-][cc]##My friend has an ipod, and although the sound quality probably won't meet most audiophile standards, the product itself is better than anything creative has made.
##features[-][u][cc]It hold's a promised amount of songs, and the headphone jack/volume controls deliver a more impressive performance than creative's.   
##If you're an audiophile, you already know that mp3 players are far from impressive. 
##player[-][s]However, this one makes an ipod sound like your old LP's, so even if you're a casual listener, I'd advise that you avoid the purchase of this product. Terrible.      
[t]
##I bought this two months ago at a local retailer, after spending considerable time reading reviews here of this and other 5GB players. 
compatibility with windows media player[+3]  ##While they all seem to have their own positives and negatives, I picked the Zen Micro over the Ipod mini, because I am not an Apple person, never has been - I wanted something that is fully compatible with Windows Media Player. 
format[+2] ##Also, the WMA compression format is superior to MP3, especially at lower bit rates, so I needed a player that could handle WMA and integrate well with my Windows XP computers.  
accessories[+3] ##I was fortunate to get the packaging that still included all the accessories (desk stand/hard case, belt clip, wall charger, etc). 
Zen Micro[+3] ##And so far, I have been very, very happy with my Zen Micro. 
working[+3][u] ##It's being used daily and I have had none of the problems reported by other reviewers (headphone jack, player locking up, etc). 
##Just in case, I bought a two-year extended warranty for about 15% of the purchase price of the player.   
##I promptly gave the included earbuds to my wife, I'm using a pair of Sennheiser PXC250 noise-canceling headphones with the Zen Micro. 
features[+3], user interface[+3] ##The Micro has an impressive array of very nice features and a well designed user interface. 
feel[+3] ##What I like the most:  - Small and solid feel. 
size[+2],feel[+2] ##The Zen Micro is smaller than it looks in pictures, and feels very solid. 
backlight[+3] ##The blue backlight is pretty cool. 
screen[+2], touchpad[+2] ##The screen is clear and readable, and the touch pad works very well, it took me less than a day to get the hang of it, and now I like it better than having to click buttons or fiddle with a separate volume control.  
sound[+3], audio quality[+3] ##- Great sound! I was very impressed, I encode at 192 kbps and the audio quality is great, especially with the better headphones. 
##I managed to fit about 700 tracks on the player, but many of those are 6-15 minute long classical tracks.   
##- Integration with Media Player. 
transfer[+2], sync with media player[+1][u] ##The first thing I did was upgrade the firmware to the version required for WMP10, it syncs flawlessly with Media Player and transfers are fast.  
battery[+1] ##- Replaceable battery. 
##A must for me, the fact that you can carry extra batteries is a big bonus.  
##- The FM Radio. 
##I find myself listening to the radio a lot. 
##You have to be in an area with good reception, but where I live I can get most of my favorite stations quite well.  
##- Doubles as a removable disk drive. 
interface[+2][u] ##With the right firmware, drag and drop to and from the player like any other jump drive.  
player[+3][p] ##I have not yet used all the features, like the calendar, etc, but as a music player this little thing rocks.  
battery life[-2] ##The only reason for not giving it 5 stars: the claimed battery life of 12 hours is very optimistic - possible maybe if you really sit down and listen continuously for 12 hours without ever touching the player, but in real life I can probably get 6-8 hours at most. 
##Plus, from the Creative discussion forums it is clear that they have some problems with excessive battery drainage with the current firmware. 
##They seem to be working on a fix and will probably sort it out soon. 
##For me, I get through a typical day's listening just fine, and I could probably squeeze out two days, but it really is no big deal to just charge the Micro overnight. 
battery life[-2] ##Even the "shorter" battery life, though, has not impaired my positive experience with the Zen Micro in any way. 
warranty price[+2][u], accessories[+2], player[+][s] ##If you can get one with all the accessories and a cheap extended warranty, this is the player to get! Highly recommended.     
[t]
##Update 8/11/05:  The latest release of the iPOD firmware fixes teh calender sync bug i noted below.  
##I bought this a couple of months ago after researching all the reviews comparing with the iPod mini. 
price[+2] ##The Micro seeemed like an iPod for less. 
##I got rid of my older PDA figuring that since the only function I used on it anyways was to manage my contacts and calender, I could now use my Zen Micro.  
sound[+3] ##Pros: - Excellent sound, even with the headphones that come out of the box, but it absolutely rocked with my Bose Quietcomfort 2 set. 
look[+3], size[+3][u] ##- Looks sleek, compact, has a radio.  
accessories[-2] ##Limitations: - Not a lot of original accessories like the iPod. 
##I waited for Creative's FM transmitter for a month, finally bought a Belkin Tunecast II, which is not great. 
##I get occasional hiss while driving. 
battery life[-2] ##- The battery life leaves a lot to be desired. 
## Though rated at 12 hrs, I could barely manage 8 and I have two spares as well. 
firmware[-3] ##I downloaded the new firmware which was supposed to take care of the problem, but it hasn't worked. 
outlook sync[-2] ##- The outlook synch only works for non recurring appointments, which personally is very annoying to me but probably wont be to most people. - ##Several people complained about the touchpad and frankly i'm starting to see why. 
touchpad[-1] ##I occassionally flip songs while working out as i accidently hit the pad even lightly (yes i have it in maximum desensitized mode). 
##I wish they has a "lock" function like cell phones to prevent this. 
audible.com book compatibility[-3][u] ##- Not compatible with Audible.com books.  
Zen Micro[-2] ##Overall, it does its basic function very well, but we expect more from the mp3 players today and the Zen Micro does not rise to the occassion.     
[t]
##I first signed up for Napster on line.  
##Loved the service so much I decided to buy an MP3 player and upgrade from the basic Napster to Napster To Go. 
##They have a list of compatible players which I miss read.  
##So my first MP3 player purchase was incorrect.  
##To transfer songs requires you to pay 99 cents.  
##The player I first purchased was the Creative Nomad Jukebox Zen Xtra 40 GB MP3 Player.  
##This player is not compatible with Napster To Go. 
##The player was large and bulky.  
##The buttons are located on the sides making it difficult to use.  
##The plus was the storage size but I didn't like hearing the hard drive spin.  
##I also hated the packaging, with a passion.  
##It was one of those plastic glued containers that can take you thirty minutes to open.  
##Accessories were cheap looking.  
##The player was not very appealing either.  
##All this before I found out the bad news.  
##Finally I upgraded the firmware and log in to Napster.  
##Upon logging in I received a notification that my player works with Napster but not Napster To Go. 
##It was time to exchange it for the other player the Creative Zen Micro 5 GB MP3 Player Black.  
##Its a few bucks more and has only 5 GB's of storage but its well worth the trade off. 
##This is Creative's attempt to compete with the IPod mini.  
##To bad Napster software is not compatible with Apple IPod's.  
##Its my first purchase choice.  
##Actually only three players are on the list for Napster To Go. 
player[+3][p] ##Don't worry this player rocks.  
appeal[+3] ##It was also the most appealing.   
##Immediately you could tell a very distinct difference between the two Creative MP3 players.  
packing[+3][u] ##For the Zen Creative focused on packaging which looked well thought out, well presented and easy to open and put back together.  
##I keep boxes for all my equipment for storage and moving.  
casing[+3] ##It has a cardboard slip cover with a nice layered box casing inside.  
## You will find a small folder/envelope on top along with the player.  
##Accessories are in reusable bags unlike the Nomad which requires you to tear each back plastic store bag open. 
case[+3] ##A distinct IPod relation is evident with white colored cables, power plug and the very nice Zen case with a white rubber inside covering.  
##It has Apple insipid written all over it.  
design[+3] ##I do give create to Creative for their attractive design.    
functionality[+2] ##Creative has put a lot of effort into making this player appeal to those true geeks that search for coolness and functionality in electronic devices. 
player[+1][p]##Creative was defiantly giving the IPod a run for their money with this device.  
player[+][p][cs]##It makes the Nomad I purchase feel and look like junk.  
quality[+2] ##Everything shines of quality.  
player[+1][cs] ##I was more excited about this player upon opening than I was about the Nomad.  
##First I removed each piece and laid them out on my coffee table.  
accessories[+2] ##I am now staring at an array of stuff including Zen Micro player, stereo earbud headphones, a rechargeable lithium-ion battery, an AC/DC power adapter, a USB 2.0 cable, a belt-clip, a stand, a stylish cloth pouch, an installation CD, a quick-start guide, and Creative MediaSource software.  
##Next I wanted to update the software, after a quick firmware upgrade the player was ready to go. 
##I sync the player with Napster software and it downloaded the library I had already created. 
##My PC only supports USB 1.0 not the 2.0 which is blazing fast. 
##So the download was much slower.   
interface[+3] ##The interface works great.  
touchpad[+2] ##I enjoy getting use to the touch pad. 
navigation[+2] ##In minutes I was easily navigating through the menus.  
sound[+3] ##What impressed me most was the sound.  
sound[+3] ##At 128 the songs sound very good.  
##My hobby is home audio and home theater.  
audio quality[+2] ##The Zen lives up to the audio quality I love and expect.  
headphones[+2] ##The Earbuds are great headphones as good as my AGK Studio 240, well not as good but darn close.  
##Creative says that the software engine for this MP3 is the best hands down.  
##I believe them.  
##Overall this play is my introduction into the market.  
Zen[+][s]##The Zen was an impressive purchase and I would highly recommend it to anyone using Napster.  
##If you're an itunes person then no one could argue against an IPod.      
[t]
##I got my Zen Micro last week. 
player[+3][p] ##I absolutely love it. 
size[+3] ##It's so small. 
look[+3]##It looks sleek and modern. 
storage[+3] ##It holds plenty of songs. 
sound[+3] ##The sound is amazing. 
menu[+2] ##The menu is easy to use and understand. 
touchpad controls[+2] ##I love the touchpade controls. 
touchpad controls[+2][p] ##They're easy to use. 
radio[+2], voice recording[2] ##The radio and voice recording are nice. 
headphones[+2] ##The earbud headphones are really nice. 
batterylife[+2] ##The battery has a long life. 
battery replacement[+2] ##It's rechargable and supposedly easy to replace though I haven't had to do it yet of course. 
file transfer/rip software[+2] ##The file ripping/transfering software that comes with the player is easy to use. 
file transfer[+2][p][cc] ##It's faster than WMP. 
player[+1] ##So far I have no complaints with this player. 
player[+][s] ##If anyone is thinkning of getting an ipod mini, forget it and go with this player. 
price[+2], storage[+2], size[+2] ##It's cheaper, holds more songs and is smaller.      
[t]
##If you are like me who wants move to the next phase of portable audio from conventional portable CD players I hope you find this usefull.   
##Space : 5GB =2500 songs. 
##If you have a huge CD collection, 5GB can hold only a part of your CD collection. 
##Remember mp3 format lets you store tons of songs. 
storage[+2][u]##I have stored 40 audio CDs and i still have close to 2.8 GB free.   
software[+2] ##User Interface: The software is simple and straight forward. 
##Havent read the manual till now (remember I am good time computer user). 
PC  software[-2] ##PC software that comes with the player is not as simple as i Tunes but its not bad at all. 
scroll bar[-1] ##The scrol bar agian takes some getting used to. 
storage [+2][u] ##You can use the player to store your computer data files (Good feature to have).   
Battery[+3] ##Battery : A Big Big plus. 
battery usage[+2][u]##Most of the other players I checked dont have user servicable battery. 
##Zen micro does. 
##I have two spare batteries (brought on ebay for 28 bucks each). 
##Remember this is a huge plus when travelling. 
battery life[+2][u] ##Each battery lasts about 10-11 hours. 
##If one battery drains just snap the spare one and you are back in bussiness. 
battery charging[+2][u] ##Another good feature is that you can charge the battery by just connecting the player to your computer using the USB cable.  
FM tuner[+2] ##FM tuner & Microphone : Having a tuner in the player is a blessing. 
##Dont have to switch to another device for FM tuner.  
FM reception[-2][u] ##Since zen does not have an external antena it has some problems catching weak signals but it works. 
microphone[+3] ##Builtin microphone is great for recording short voice notes. 
##I have heard in other players these have to be brought separately.    
sound[+3] ##Sound: This is where I love Zen the most. 
sound[+3] ##Excellent sound I mean the player has juice. 
##I dont use the headphones that come with it instead I use Bose Triport headphones. 
##The player has great potential (ur experiance may differ based on your headphones). 
bass[+3], treble[+3] ##The bass treble the sound detail is awsome. 
player[+][cc] ##I compared it to other CD players (Two models of Panasonic, Rio & samsung) and they were no way even near Zen Micro.  
look[+2] ##Looks and shape: I have a black one and the first time I charged it and switched it on jeez the blue light looked so cool. 
size[+2] ##Its compact and has rounded edges. 
size[+1] ##Fits well in hand in trouser pockets.   
belt clip[+1], stand[+1] ##Freebies you get: A cradle with detachable stand and belt clip, some thing very handy and useful. 
belt clip[-1], design[-2] ##I dont use the belt clip cuz it fails to hold the player securely (design problem). 
##Instead I use a cellphone cover with a belt clip and it works just fine. 
headphones[-3], accessories[+2] ##You get a USB cable headphones, a pouch, software except headphones you will like every thing else.  
headphones[-2], beltclip design[-2] ##What I dont like: Nothing much except Headphones, Belt clip design. 
##Creative has not lounched any silicon cover for the player like ipod's (I think belkin makes it for ipod).  
##Stuff you may need to buy: Wired remote from creative. 
##This is a must have. 
##Spare batteries incase  you need some extra hours without charging. 
sound[+2] ##FM transmitter (belkin has a good one) to use Zen with your car Sterio FM Tunner   Latest Find: Connected this baby to my $3800 audiophile audio system and it produced clean sound compared to Ipod. 
##Tested with the same mp3 for benchmarking     
[t]
##I can't help but feel peeved by the attitude created by Apple enthusiasts that basically detracts from anything that attempts to compete with Apple products in the marketplace.  
player[+2][u] ##Thankfully, Creative has come through with a product that puts the Ipod back in its place.  
Zen micro[+2] ##While I have not had the "privilege", as many call it, of owning an Ipod, based on the experience of friends who have had some misfortune with their Ipod (and subsequently purchased the Zen Touch or Zen Micro), I can pretty much rest assured that my decision to purchase the Zen Micro was one of the more informed ones.
##Nevertheless, I still get shirked when someone out of ignorance states "But it's not an IPod!" or "Never heard of it, I'll go with the IPod". 
##_  About the hype:  I must applaud Creative for their restraint.  
player[+2] ##By focusing exclusively on quality rather than excessive marketing, they have introduced a player that can look the Ipod straight in the eye and not flinch.  
Zen micro[+][s] ##While I'm not too keen on their customer service (none of the products I have from Creative have given me issues), I can definitely recommend the Zen Micro for the simple fact that it does exactly what it is supposed to do and more...without needing any of the extra hype except word of mouth.  
##Apple, on the other hand, seems to have engaged in a blind marketing strategy that seeks to obliterate competition through utter abuse of marketing channels and un-orthodox "free player" schemes that just seem to pimp the product without pimping the features.  
##The result, while naturally encompassing the acquisition of greater market share, is a mediocre product that stands out sorely in terms of quality and value when compared in a virtual vacuum to its competitors.  
look[+2][u], size[+2], battery life[+2] ##About the product:  The Zen Micro is a sleek, stylish device that caters not just to "hip" youngsters but to people of all walks of life who like to listen on the go without having to worry frequently about battery life, size, or the "awkward" factor.  
size[+2], design{+3], ##It fits comfortably in my shirt pocket and while very well-designed, doesn't look to ostentatious while I'm walking around with it.  
interface[+1] ##The interface, while a bit confusing at first, is very easy to navigate after about 15 minutes.  
battery life[+3] ##Battery life is exceptional, lasting longer than the 8-10 hours that seem reasonable with most music players on the market.  
file transfer[+2][u], software[+2] ##Transferring files couldn't be easier thanks to the included software bundle.  
organizer[+2],software[+2] ##Also, I am quite partial to the Creative MediaSource Organizer and Player software, which I had with Audigy ZS sound card originally; it is definitely an added plus.  
design[+2], features[+2] ##All-in-all, Creative has definitely come up with a winner in terms of product design and features, and I look forward to the Nomad/Zen line of products seizing more market share as people begin to realize that quality is a better determinant of experience than quantity and hype.  
configuration[-1][u] ##P.S.  The only snag I encountered while initially configuring the device was trying to hook up the Micro to a front USB port.  The bus for the front port on my motherboard did not have enough power; after connecting it to the rear ports, it works perfectly.     
[t]
look[+2], player[-2][p] ##This device looks pretty nice but it's really not very competitive.  
player[-][cc] ##The iPod mini is smaller and sexier, albeit limited in supported formats and the Rio Karma is a far better value.  
storage[-][cc], format[-2][cc] ##The karma is only $5 more, it's small, had a 20 gig drive and supports more formats including ogg.  
look[+][cc], interface[-2] ##The karma doesn't look as sexy but it's interface is very efficiently designed.  
##In fact, it's much better than the iPod in that regard. 
##The karma also has a very long battery life.  
##Having owned both the karma and other Creative Lab products (including Zen) I would have to say the Karma also sounds better.  
##No comparison in my opinion.     
[t]
functioning[+1] ##Initially, I was very impressed, after loading 180 songs it seemed to function very well but then it would lock up on me and a battery removal remedied this, I then downloaded the upgrades and everything seemed to be alright. 
auto load[-2] ##After a week I tried to load some more songs and delete a few but the auto load didn't do anything but turn on my player. 
##I tried to figure out another way to load the songs and attempted another upgrade with no results. 
##I emailed the company and after 2 days was told to read their Q&A site and then download again. 
##I tried the help menu that referenced GUI buttons that don't exist on my version. 
##I'm less than satisfied. 
software[-3] ##It seems like the software is just not responding. 
support[-3] ##The support has been less than impressive, considering the cost. 
##They responded -after I told them I have a Zen Micro and suggested that my "jukebox" needed to be purged. 
support[-3][u] ##I'm going to try to get a refund but considering all the hoops I jumped through (emails, downloads, reboots, a purge and another download, plus reading through the help menu) a refund should be twice as frustrating.     
[t]
##After narrowing my choices down to the Zen Micro or IPod Mini, I read countless reviews on both for about a week until my eyes practically started bleeding. 
##I really like both of them and as with any other popular products, they both have their share of negative reviews warning of their shortcomings. 
##When I finally couldn't take it anymore, I decided to pull the trigger on the Zen Micro. 
storage[+2], battery[+2], features[+2][u] ##The extra GB of hardrive space, removeable battery and FM tuner, as well as the fact that I was previously a satisfied owner of the Nomad II put it over the top for me. 
##Not to mention that everyone else at the office has an IPod, so I was kinda' hoping for a good alternative. 
working[+2] ##Fortunately for me, I have yet to have a single problem with this player.  
##After reading the reviews, I was all ready for the unit to lock up on me after the initial charge...but it never happened. 
interface[+2], controls[+2] ##I think the OS and controls are very well thought out and although I'll admit I was a bit intimidated during my first few hours with the Micro, the interface and controls became second nature after the first day or so. 
##My preference for the touchpad sensitivity setting is 'medium'. 
##One reviewer made what *I thought* was a good point about the volume not having an independant control and being buried in a menu, but must not have spent very long with the player because if you slide your finger up or down the center touch button during a song, the volume goes up or down accordingly. 
##A few reviewers have also complained about the printed manual which is probably one of the biggest wastes of paper ever included with an electronic device. 
manual[+1] ##However, there is a more detailed PDF manual on the CD (and online) that should answer any questions about the operational features of the Zen Micro. 
software[-2] ##While the software may not be as easy as I-Tunes, it is not difficult to use by any stretch. 
loading speed[+2] ##As opposed to the Nomad II or any other flash based player, the songs load extremely fast...about one or two seconds per song. 
editing titles[+1] ##I also like the fact that you can edit your MP3 titles, etc. 
##after they have been loaded into the Zen which is something I've had to do many times already. 
sound[+2] ##After comparing the included Creative earbuds directly against my Sony MD-E828LP's and Sennheiser MX-400's, I find myself still using the Creative's, which in my opinion, sound every bit as good and have a slightly longer cord.  
FM reception[-2] ##If I was pressed to find a negative aspect of the Zen Micro I would probably have to mention weak FM reception, but the building where I primarily use the Micro seems to have a history of terrible radio reception anyway, so you can take that for what it's worth.  
##Zen Micro[+2][s] Overall, I'm very pleased with the Zen Micro and based on my experience with it (as well as it's older sibling Creative Nomad IIC), can recommend it without reservation. 
##I say get one today!!     
[t]
functioning[-3] ##It had issues right off the bat, with freezing up, staying in 'SHUTTING DOWN' mode, and just not functioning very well in general. 
touch pad[-2], access[-2] ##The touch-pad would be a great thing if it worked well, and as I never had issues getting songs transferred to the player, I did have problems accessing them from the player.   
make[-3][u] ##Many other reviewers are mentioning that they have had no problems at all> I would say that the main problem is that this player is just not made very well. 
player[-3][u] ##It is the 'first generation' of the player, and while I still agree that it is a great alternative to the iPod, I think there are many others that would be a much better value for your buck.   
player[-][s] ##If someone asked me flat out, i'd say to go woth something else.      
[t]
##After heavy duty research and reading reviews, I decided to plunge into the MP3 player circus and got myself the Zen Micro. 
##Why not join the iPodders like the rest of the world? 
##I have my reasons. 
##I've played around with a friend's iPod a couple times and it IS a cool unit. 
price[+1], design[+1] ##Perhaps I bought the Micro to be different, the cheaper price tag (from Amazon), the design, or avoiding the high iPod theft in NYC subways. 
player[+2][p] ##Whichever it may be, I'm happy I've made this purchase.  
##I waited a week to make the Micro worthy of a review. 
size[+2] ##When I opened the box, I was shocked by the size of this thing... It's TINY! 
look[+2][u], size[+2][u] ##It's shorter, sleeker, more compact and fits comfortably in my small hand than the iPod...My Nokia cell phone towers over this bad boy! 
interface[+1], trim[+1] ##The interface has a sassier flair and the blue-lit trimming is an added bonus. 
##The iPods, like most Mac products, have a sophisticated but bland, look to them... Preferrably, I like some sass. 
##:) I was also happy that my shipment came with all the accessories (minus extra battery). 
##In stores, the Micro doesn't even come with the AC adapter.  
sound[+1] ##Moving on to sound department... It delivers! 
##I expected this coming from Creative. 
earbuds[+1], bass[-2] ##The earbuds, on the other hand, are decent in sound, but lacking in bass. 
earbuds[-1] ##I've since replaced it with a pair of black Sennheisers... Not only are the packaged earbuds pretty uncomfortable, but are too similar to iPod's and can target iPod theives here in NYC. 
functionality[+2], navigation[+2], touchpad[-1] ##Functionality, menus are easy to navigate... As many have mentioned, the touch pads take some time to get used to, but I've gotten used to it. 
##I actually prefer the vertical strip rather than running my thumb in continuous circular motion. 
design[-1] ##Although, I thought it could've been designed a bit better.  
extra features[+1] ##There are extra features packed inside this unit (some that most will hardly ever use) such as FM radio tuner, voice recorder, calendar, and alarm clock. 
##I'm guessing the more features you enable, the more the battery will drain. 
battery usage[+1][u] ##Speaking of battery, it's removable AND replaceable! 
##The life-span on it, though, is NOT as advertised, but if you're not a heavy user, you can tick in at 9-10 hours of playback. 
##And if you read the description on Creative's site, it does mention that the "actual battery life will vary with use."
Micro[+2] ##Overall, the Micro is a solid device and I haven't fell into a problem with it yet *knocks on wood*. 
storage[-1][u] ##It's perfect for those who aren't planning on storing tons of music. 
music transfer[+1] ##Transferring music is a breeze. I don't subscribe to music services, but as mentioned on other reviews, Micro allows you to subscribe to services OTHER than iTunes. 
features[+2], sound quality[+2] ##It may not top the iPod Mini, but it's definitely an alternative if you also want the extra features and good sound quality.  
design[+2], size[+2][u], comfort[+2][u], look[+2] ##Strong Points: - Design: small, comfortable, curved, and stylish. 
variety of colours[+2] - Colors: 10 variety of HOT colors made it difficult to choose from. 
sound[+3] ##You don't need to cough up an extra couple bucks for a "special edition" to get black! - Sound: Awesome! - Batteries: removable/replaceable. 
audio formats[+2] ##- Audio Formats: supports both MP3, WMA... And yeah, WAV too.  
touch pad[-2], design[-1], volume control[-1] Weak Points: - Touch Pad: design could be better - Volume Control: controlled through the vertical strip, but purchasing a headphone with built-in volume control will do the trick. 
FM reception[-2][u] ##- Radio Quality: weak reception     
[t]
look[-3][u], storage[+1] ##It's nice that the Zen Micro has bells and whistles like FM (but where's AM???) and voice recording, and 20% more storage than "the other" mini MP3 player, but why is it so (...)ugly?  
color[-2], touchpad[-2] ##The colors are a joke, and I personally hate the stupid vertical touchpad. 
design[-3] ##But my biggest gripe is still the extremely ugly design.  
audio[+2], player[-3][u] ##What's the point of having "good audio" in your hand when your g/f thinks you have no taste whatsoever and your friends laugh their heads off while proudly showing off their iPod Mini?  
##Creative should hire some real industrial designers.     
[t]
software[-3] ##Still has terrible software.  
software[-3][p] ##You have to wonder why Creative can't get this right.  
look[+2], controls[-3], touchpad[-2][u] ##Looks nice but the conrols are awkward and the entire front is touch sensitive.  
storage[+2][u] ##You do get 1 more GB than an iPod mini.  
screen review[-2] ##Screen review could be better.  
screen review[-][cc] ##Apple stil does it better but needs to come out with a 5 gig mini.     
[t]
player[+3][p] ##This product is amazing and better than the Ipod you can get at the same price. 
storage[+1], cost[+1] ##the 4G Ipod costs the same as this 5G Zen Micro. 
features[+2][u] ##It also has a voice recorder and FM radio that you can only get on an Ipod if you but an adapter seperately. 
design[+3] ##Creative did an awesome job with the design. 
headphones[+2], extra accessories[+2][u] ##The headphones have great sound and durability and mine came with some extras when I bought it (a stand, a belt hook, charger) that I know doesn't come with every one. 
player[+2][p] ##I have the black one and adore it. 
look[+2], background light[+3] ##It looks nice and sleek and the blue background light looks awesome against the black. 
touchpad[-1][u] The touch buttons do take a little getting used to and I don't like how the scroll button is the same button used as an "enter" key, but you get used to it and it isn't a big deal. 
##I take mine everywhere.     
[t]
size[+1], style[+1] ##I bought my Zen Micro three months ago mainly because I preferred the size and style to the iPod mini. 
player[+2] ##Overall, I've been very impressed with the player. 
functioning[+2][u] ##I've had almost no problems with the firmware (ie, lock-ups, shut-downs etc), but I have kept the player up to date. 
##Also, the latest version of the firmware seems to actual deliver (in fact, more than deliver) the 12 hour battery life the specifications claim. 
##Originally I was only getting around 8 hours of playtime out of my Zen Micro, but now I consistently get 10-13. 
firmware[+1] ##I'm not sure whether this is related to the charge cycle of its Li-Ion battery, the better firmware, or a combination of both factors. 
battery life[+2][u] ##I imagine if I left my player untouched (no backlight) it could play for considerably more than 12 hours at a low volume level.  
sync to windows media player[+1] ##One of my favorite features about the player is its ability to sync to Windows Media Player. 
##With the latest version (10), I can simply browse my WMP library, adding songs/albums/artists to the sync list, and then sync all of the tracks at any time. 
speed[+2][u], look[+2] ##Its just as fast as the included Creative software, but much less invasive, and overall better looking. 
##With WMP10, you don't need to install any software other than the driver, which makes using multiple computers fairly simple.  
touchpad[+2] ##The touchpad is great once you get used to it, and I much prefer it to standard buttons or scroll wheels (as on the Dell DJ for example). 
touchpad[2][p] ##They are sensitive and accurate (perhaps too accurate, it senses through t-shirt cloth, but the touchpad can be locked), but easy to clean, unlike buttons. 
touchpad[+1] ##Also, the touchpad seems to be waterproof to some degree.  
FM reception[-2] ##The FM radio's reception isn't spectacular, but it will pick up the most powerful stations in any given metro area. 
radio record[+1] ##Its ability to record radio is useful as well, but would have been moreso if it could be preset.  
look[+3], feel[+3], sound[+3] ##The player looks great, feels great, and sounds great. 
durability[+2] ##So far it has been very durable (other than the little pads on the earbuds), but those aren't really necessary as I find them comfortable on their own. 
earbuds[+2][p][cc] ##They also sound excellent compared to other earbuds including retail sets like Panasonics and Sennheisers. 
built[+3][u] I've dropped the device several times onto hard surfaces, and it still works flawlessly.     
[t]
##Every few years I crawl out into the electronic world, in search of a new MP3 player to replace the horribly inadequate one I currently own. 
Zen micro[+2] ##This year, it seems that I choose my timing perfectly, having discovered the awesome device that is the Zen Micro.  
##Of all the players that I have owned in the past (6 of them), all of them have had drawbacks and problems. 
##Although some came close to perfection, none of them left me completely happy with their performance. 
##To me, the key elements that must be present in an MP3 player are as follows:  -Fast transference of songs to player -Well-designed computer-side interface -Easy menu navigation and well-designed control scheme -Good sound (duh) -Reasonable battery time (~6 Hours)  That's it? 
##You ask, yup. 
##That's it. 
##I know this list is horribly unreasonable, which is why it amazes me how many players lack some of these basic features. 
##Slow file transfers, menus that take ages to cycle through, and poor battery life plague many of the!
##players that are currently available, but not the Zen Micro. 
##My list of "nice to have" features is a little longer, but it also contains nothing unreasonable: backlit screen, removable battery, FM Radio feature, ID3 Tag line support, lots of storage.  
features[+2][p] ##Everything that I have listed above, the Zen has, and more. 
navigation[+3][u] ##The menus are easy to scroll through; they are laid out naturally, and make sense. 
interface[+2] ##The computer interface is 90% good, only losing points due to the fact that "Creative" branding is all over the place within it. 
transfer speed[+3], battery life[+3] ##Songs transfer lightning fast, and the two batteries that came in my box give me 24 hours of listen time. 
features[+2] ##On the fly play list creation, address book, removable storage drive capabilities, sound recorder, the list goes on people, this thing is literally so chalked full of goodies, it was like Halloween all over again. 
design[+3], ease ofuse[+2] ##So far I have used all of the above-mentioned features, and find them well designed, and easy to understand.  
##Not everything in this world is 1!
Zen[-2] ##00% good though, and the Zen does have a few drawbacks. 
file transfer[-2] ##While transferring songs to the player, the interface has crashed a few times (4-5 times in a 4-5 hour period) normally this would cause me major concern, but it appears that this bug is reproducible, which leads me to believe that Creative will fix it with a patched version shortly (or maybe it's just my computer). 
response speed[-1][u] ##Another thing I don't like is that some of the features take 1-2 seconds to load up. 
##These are limited to the voice recorder, address book, and such. 
##I will be using the player 99% of the time as an MP3 device, so these small pauses are entirely bearable, for the added features just to be available. 
##Really that's all I can find wrong with it, it took some major bouncing around to get a song to skip (there is a hard drive within), and I don't forsee jogging (wich I plan to do with it tonight) to cause any problems whatsoever (if it does, I'll update this).

##UPDATE March 3rd, 2005: I bought my Dark Blue Zen Micro back in November, when they first came out. 
features[+][cc], sound quality[+2], music source support[+2] ##Right out of the box, I loved it, better features than the Ipod, great sound quality and no limitations on what music sources I can use. 
##I loaded my whole CD collection on it and took it everywhere, even at work. 
player[+3][p] ##So, I was one who was ready to give it 5 stars with no complaints at all. 
##Then last week, my player just quit working, period. 
warranty[-1]  ##After consulting with Creative's customer support, they determined that the hard drive was broken and the only recourse was to send it in for repair, which would cost me $40, since it's past the 90 day warranty (pretty short warranty). 
##They said the repair could take weeks, and being impatient, I decided to just order another one, 1 day delivered from Amazon, and then I could have two, one for at work and one for at home. 
working[-2] ##Well, I got my second player, and right out of the box it wasn't working right and once again, after consulting customer se!
##rvice, they said I should send it in for repairs.  
##I loved the Zen Micro, and thus it pains me to say this, but I have a hard time recommending something, when I've had two of them break on me in such a short time of owning them. 
quality[-2], reliability[-2] ##They obviously have quality and reliability problems. 
player[-][s] ##They have a good concept here, and I normally expect a lot better quality from Creative, so maybe they will do better with the next gen version, but for now I say buyer beware.  
player[+2][p] ##ORIGINAL REVIEW December 2004 I'm sorry to read about other people having problems with their Zen Micro, but mine has worked great! 
player[+2][p] ##This is my first MP3 player and I am so impressed with what such a small device can do.  
sound[+3], rip[+2] ##I have ripped over 100 songs from my CD collection and it was so easy and fast, and they all sound great.  
##I didn't experience any problems with the software or getting my computer to recognize the player.  
##My PC is running Windows 98 though....maybe having old outdated things is a good thing for once! 
##Y!
interface[-1] ##es, the interface took a little getting used to, but once I did, it's almost second nature now.  
organization[+2][u] ##I love that you can create custom playlists, and organize music in so many different ways.  
WAV format[-3] ##Only slight negatives I've had so far is that I haven't been able to get it to accept any of my WAV files yet.  
##It's supposed to support that format, but I keep getting a file transfer failure no matter what I try. 
case[-2] ##My other nit is that it didn't include at least some kind of carrying case for everything.  
belt clip[-1] ##Yes, there is a belt clip, but that doesn't hold the extra battery and usb cable.  
bag[-3] ##The little bag it comes with is cheap and useless.  
bag[-2] ##It barely holds anything and mine just puts a bunch of thread fuzzies all over the player, because the bag is cheap and seems to be coming apart.  
##I threw it away.  
##Those are minor complaints though.  
player[+][s] ##I love my dark blue zen micro and would definitely recommend it.  
##Soon I will have every CD song I care about from my collection to carry around with me.  
##Amazing.

##I'm a new to mp3 players.  
##For years I've downloaded songs and burned CDs, but I decided to simplify my life and get an mp3 player.  
##After reading reviews and talking to a few friends, I decided on the Zen.  
player[-2] ##It is not a perfect product but it does have a lot going for it.  
features[+2] ##The FM tuner, the 5G of storage, and the removable disk are all great features.  
##The removable disk isn't really explained in the product literature but basically it allows you to partition a portion of the drive for data.  
##You can then hook up the Zen via USB to any Win2K or later computer and use that partition to store data files.  
##Any audio files in this area can't be played by the player.  
##I primarily got the Zen to use for band practice, so I use the removable disk to store lyrics and sheet music.  
look[2] ##The fit and finish of the product is first-rate.  
##The slow throbbing glow that it emits during charging is cool too.  
interface[-1] ##On the downside, I think the interface takes some getting used to and the Zen software !
software[-2][p] ##is not as intuitive as I would like.  
earbuds[-1] ##Also, the earbuds that came with it sound great but are uncomfortable (although my wife didn't have a problem), so I bought a pair of over-the-ear headphones.  
##I haven't used the Organizer feature (apparantly you can sync with Outlook).  
##You can also record with the built in mic and record FM broadcasts, I haven't tried those either.  
player[+2][p] ##Overall, I am very pleased with it.  
player[+2][p] ##The more I use it and figure out how to do things, the more I like it.

##I would give the Creative Zen Micro five stars without hesitation...except for the eight hours of my life I can never get back. 
##Doing what, you ask? 
##Why, troubleshooting, mediating software conflicts, devising workarounds, and when things got too bizarre, even calling tech support.  
##Now, there's nothing wrong with the Zen Micro a few months in beta testing wouldn't iron out. 
##But, they rushed it to market, so you, general public, get to roll the dice. 
##Are you feeling lucky today? 
##Who knows -- you may avoid a migraine altogether.  
sound quality[+3] ##Before you run out and buy an iPod, understand something: there are REASONS the Zen is worth encountering this kind of hassle, principally excellent (for MP3) sound quality.  
headphones[+][cc] ##The supplied headphones are hands-down better than the mediocre iPod buds. 
##That said, you can get more of what the Zen is capable of by donating them to your local iPod person (they're white) and getting a pair of $60-$80 aftermarket headphones. 
##I'm getting stunningly good resul!
##ts with Sennheiser HD-497 phones. 
##Going further up-market and using super hi-rez audiophile headphones is probably overkill; they will only serve to cast MP3 limitations into sharper relief, and honey, you can't hear what ain't there.  
##An aside about sound quality: You can have good sound or 2,000+ songs, not both. 
##You're better off not dropping below 128 kbps, especially with music. 
##64 kbps is a terrible price to pay. 
##If you absolutely, positively need over 2,000 songs for your next wolverine photo shoot, get a 10 GB player.   
size[+2][u] ##The player is smaller than you think. 
##Something about the pictures suggests a deck-of-cards size, but you can hide the Micro completely under a standard business card.  
touchpad[-2] ##The touch pad is over-sensitive, and is adjustable to only slightly oversensitive. 
##You quickly learn to brush your thumb ever so lightly over its surface.  
##To minimize any frustration (and the odds that you may return a usable unit), keep the following in mind:  1. While your unit is!
##unboxed and charging up, visit the Creative website for necessary firmware and/or driver upgrades, especially if you're planning to use a service like Napster. ##Keep in mind the required upgrade may be a beta version (mine was).  
##2. 
##Some upgrades are needed for the Micro to work properly with the Windows XP operating system and Media Player 10.  
##3. 
You may need to briefly disable various spam blockers, cookie swatters, and antivirus programs (I know, I know -- get offline first). 
##My gatekeeper programs kept fixes away a few times until I got wise to it.  
sound quality[+3], music subscription service[+2] ##Bottom line: If you value excellent sound quality and the ability to use music subscription services, and are willing to deal with the possibility (not the certainty) of setup gremlins, by all means get the Zen Micro.     
[t]
##I bought this item in part due to the good reviews here on Amazon. 
software[-3] ##The machine itself seems fine, but the software that came with it is AWFUL. 
player[-2] ##After installation, the very first time I booted up the Creative MediaSource Organizer, intending to use its CD burning and ripping functions, it totally shorted out. 
##I tried everything to make it work - followed advice from Microsoft support, uninstalled and reinstalled the whole thing, rebooted every five minutes, ran a virus scan on my computer, checked my drives for errors, everything. 
working[-2] ##I was up all night trying to make the stupid thing work, to no avail. 
customer support[-3] ##Of course one of the first things I did was write an email to the customer support at Creative, through their website, and by the time they finally got back to me - several working days later when they promise only one - their suggestions were completely worthless. 
##Now I have to wait another few days for them to get back to me again, probably with more worthless suggestions? 
##And t!
player[-3] ##his is what I get for my $200 on this MP3 player?  
##I think I'll stick to CDs.     
[t]
Zen micro[+2] ##The Zen Micro is near perfect.   
##I bought my Zen Micro last december as a christmas gift to myself, save for a few software issues, I couldn't be happier with my purhcase.   
##I've owned this player for nine months now and it's been on 5 cross country trips, one trans-atlantic honeymoon, and numerous roadtrips. 
##It's been in my pocket, in my car, and in my bag in 20 inches of snow and 100 degree summers. 
#3It's been dropped, shuffled, kicked, and Lumbered. 
built[+3][u] ##It's still alive, still kicking, and still playing.   
##I've never owned an Ipod, so this won't be a which one is better review.   
##All of my files are mp3 or wma, Windows Media Player is my primary music suite, i use it to burn, play, rip, and sync.
##So starting out i knew i wanted a windows friendly player. 
windows compatibility[+2][u] ##The Zen Micro (mine's black) has a lot going for it.   
size[+2][u], sound quality[+3], interface[+2][u], look[+2][u], battery[+1], features[+2] ##It fits into a hand well, it has a removable battery (this is important), great sound quality, fm stereo, recorder, smooth UI, and a feature that most unipods lack... char!
##m. 
##When it's being used or charged it emits a low pulsating blue light.   
##It's doesn't have a scroll wheel, but it has a strip! 
##Most people complain about the sensitivity, but it can easily be adjusted for personal preference.   
##My ONLY complaint is that when i first received it, it was a little buggy. 
work with WMP[-2] ##It wouldn't always work seemlessly with WMP and it often required me to restart the frozen micro by taking out the battery and restarting it. 
##over and over again. 
##But after a few firmware releases it's working without a hitch. 
##I've programed WMP to throw a few favorites on there all the time and always put my new music (less than 3 months) on so I can listen to them in the gym.   
accessories[+3] ##The accesories that come with the player are great. 
bag[+1] ##White earbuds ( i replaced those with some shure headphones, big difference), a case, a stand, a clip (which doesn't really work), and a nice little zen micro bag. 
##Also all the required cables and what not. 
##To me, currently at $218, this player is a!
player[+2][p] ##best in class. 
player[+2][p] ##It gives you the most bang for your buck, period.   
quality[+2] ##Creative has been making computer sound equipment for decades and with the zen micro it finally has something with enough quality and, yes, charm to win a nice size of the digital player pie.   
player[+][s] ##Pick your favorite color and buy it.      
[t]
##Alot of people seem to compare any music player to an Ipod. 
##Comments such as "it's stylish" or "it looks cool" or "everyone has it" don't nesseseraly make something good.
##About the Ipod: it has it's downfalls as well. 
touch sensitivity[-2] ##As for the Zen Micro:\  Cons:  I read that every button is touch sensitive, and thats very annoying when all the main buttons are on the front. 
durability[-2] ##Putting the Micro into your pocket could trigger just about anything (unless the hold feature is improved: it asks if you want to "unhold" for every button up press) Second, I'm worried about the durability of the player. 
durability[-2] ##After research of other creative hard drive players, i found that most of them aren't very durable and tend to crash (read most reviews on amazon.com and see for yourself). 
price[-2] ##Last, i find the price a bit expensive for a product such as this. 
##$190 or $200 or less would have been much more reasonable (price compareble to 20gb mp3 players). 
##As for the warrenty, i havent seen it yet, but i fear for a short on!
##e again.  
design[+2], color[+2] ##Pros The Design is very nice, and the colors are too. 
##They are bold colors, not the (personally) irratating toned down 'light' Ipod colors. 
features[+2] ##It also has tons more features then previous creative products, and most of them are very useful such as the ability to custimize the main menu to show the stuff you want, not the default items (creativelabs.com for more on that).  
battery[+1] ##The battery is also convenient, but could have been better, such as the Zen Touch's battery (but at least this one is removable).    
storage[-1][u] ##Verdict:  Had I not needed something with a tad bit more space, I consider this player fair game. 
player[+][s] ##If you don't mind all the buttons being touch sensitive, I'd recomment buying it to try out, and also buy an extra 2 year warrenty for it (there are some offered here, for about $15 dollors I think).  
##Closing: For everyone who is shallow and buys the Ipod only becouse of it's looks (i'm not saying it's necissarily bad), here's a joke: What did the Pencil Sharpener say to t!
##he Pencil? 
##Stopping going in circles and get to the point. 
##Why go in circles to find something you want? (  :)  )     
[t]
##so i admit it... i wanted a zen micro, because the appeal of the iPod was overshadowed by it's annoying trendy hipster popularity and i felt better about myself for choosing a rip off version of that trendy hipster popularity.  
player[+2][p] ##anyway, my wife got this for me for my birthday and I love the thing. 
##I mainly only get to listen to music in my car, so it's an awesome replacement for a console full of the same ten cd's that have been in there for the last 8 months that i keep forgetting to replace. 
##she also got me an iRiver FM modulator that plugs into the ligher outlet, so i can play it through my regular radio.  
##anyway, here's the pros and cons:  +linux compatible with the 1.x series of firmware. 
firmware[+2][p] ##the program is called Gnomad and works great for me and seems to cover all the features the included windows sofware does. 
look[+2],size[+2], accessories[+2][u] ##+looks snazzy +smaller than a pack of smokes - easily transported +ac charger included as well as a hardshell that comes with a clip and a stand adapter +USB cable !
##included - charges via USB, so whenever you plug it into your computer, it's charging up. 
battery life[+3], sound quality[+3] ##+Battery life is awesome IF you upgrade the firmware [requires a windows pc] OR make sure to always plug the ac adapter into the player before plugging into the outlet +Awesome sound quality... I mean it is Creative right? 
##Aren't they something of digital sound experts? 
navigation[+2] ##+Sorts music by artist, album, genre, etc... it's easy to wade through 5 gigs of tunes to find what you're looking for. 
##Also provides for playlists which are nice, but really only usefully set up through the PC software.  
##before i get into the cons, i'll make a note about the scrollpad. 
scrollpad[-1] ##It DOES take some getting used to. 
##my initial reaction was to tap the up and down arrows, when in reality, you need to touch, maintain contact and slide your finger up and down. 
##it's a little counter intuitive at first, but works great when your used to it. 
##it's a neutral feature in my book. 
##simple mechanical buttons would probably work !
##just as well and would be less confusing for new owners, but i guess they wanted to rival the iPod's search wheel. 
charging[-1] ##whatever...  on to the negatives:  -touchy about charging... you can damage the battery and seriously decrease it's life if you don't upgrade the firmware OR dont' heed the advice to always plug in the player side of the cord before plugging in the outlet side. 
##-doesn't like to be charged via USB on non windows PCs or PCs that don't have the Zen Micro driver installed. 
button functioning[-2][u] ##It has the odd side effect of the buttons only partially working? 
##Simply removing the battery and then replacing it fixes the issue, but it's annoying. 
##The new firmware fixes this as long as you put the player in lock mode before plugging it into said PC. 
users guide[-1] ##-User's guide doesn't cover a lot of important info that is covered on their website. 
##I definately recommend upgrading the firmware, which is as simple as downloading a program from creatives website and running it with your player plugged in.
##(linux geeks -> avoid the 2.x series that is aimed at windows media play!
##er compatibility, you can't downgrade the firmware.
heat[-1][u] ##) -Can't be left in the car... it immediately shuts down with an overheating error if left in a hot car for too long. 
size[+1][u] ##But since it's so small, it isn't a big deal to bring it with me.  
player[+][p][s] ##Overall though, i'm very happy with it and highly recommend it to folks looking for a mp3 player, even if it is to pretend your not a braindead consumer giving into the marketing hype of the iPod. ;)     
[t]
##I have been researching MP3 players for the last two weeks.  
##Of course the first one I decided to research first was the Apple iPod.  
##However, as soon as I found out that I could only download songs from iTunes, I immediately decided that was NOT the MP3 player for me.  
##In addition, I didn't like the fact that I'd have to pay $.99 for each song I wanted to download.    
##So I went to www.playforsure.com to see what devices were compatible with various downloading services.  
##I had been eyeing the Creative Zen Micro 5GB as I researched various players.  
Napster 2 go compatibility[+2] ##I finally decided to purchase this player because it was compatible with Napster 2 Go....which is a subscription service, allowing me to download as much music as I want for a $14.95 flat fee.  
##I have a lot of songs that I need to download.    
##I was going to purchase a pink one and then decided that I'd get a purple one because that's my favorite color....however Circuit City had it for $10 cheaper ($219.00) in black and I could !
##pick it up from the store.   
##So I decided on the black one.  
player[+2][p] ##And I must say...this MP3 is very cool.  
##It is exactly the same size as my flip phone.  
look[+2] ##It's so cute...and behind the black panel it glows in a neon blue.   
installation[+1] ##After installation, which was VERY simple....I downloaded any updated software from the Creative website, before I downloaded any music.   
##There were two downloads I had to complete.  
##One was the firmware upgrading from the installation CD and the second was regarding the "playforsure" (even though it's in BETA), to make sure I could use Napster 2 Go.  
##I then registered with Napster 2 Go and it immediately recognized my player.  
##And within one hour I had downloaded , organized my play lists and was listening to the songs I downloaded.  
##Napster 2 Go also allows members to view other members play lists in different genres, so if you are looking for lots of songs and you don't want to search for them endless, you can just grab them from other members play lists. !
sound[+2] ##The sound is very nice.  
##I feel like it's just me and the music and I am transported into a different world.  
##It also comes with a case so you can either stand it up or use a belt clip.  
##So I can't wait to get on my treadmill with it.  
lock feature[+1] ##I also like the lock feature, so it makes the touch pad inactive.   
FM reception[-2] ##I tried to use the FM radio option, but it doesn't seem to really pick up the stations I listen, however I am going to try it in a different location, it may have just been my residential location.   
##I would say the only thing I need to adjust is the sensitivity of the touch pad.  
touchpad[-2][p] ##Even when I set it to low, it's still very hard for me to adjust the player to where and what I want it to do.  
##However, I am going to try the suggestion of changing the sensitivity to high and see if that solves the problem.   
player[+2] ##Otherwise, I am extremely please with the Creative Zen Micro 5GB MP3 player.    
##PS.  
##I've been ZETAZEN long before this player came into existence...lol and my player's name is ZETAZEN. 
##:-)  www.zetazen.com

##I had to revise my review today!... If you are still trying to decide Ipod or Zen Micro, Yahoo! has just closed the deal. 
##They now offer Yahoo Music Engine, wich is like Napster to Go, but at a fraction fo the price. 
##Its $4.99 a month ($60 annually) to download as much music as you like. 
##You can fill it up with anything you like out of there 1 Million song library. 
##Also if you want to purchase music, its just .79cents per track ..... Here is my origianl review...." My wife already had the Ipod Mini when I purchased this, and I must say seeing it in action, I had some reservations about getting a Zen. 
Zen micro[+2] ##However after playing with it for three weeks now, I'm convinced, the Zen Micro is superior. 
sound quality[+3] ##I think sound quality should be the first and foremost feature, and the Zen is leaps and bounds better in sound quality, with no need to upgrade the earphones. 
FM tuner[+1] ##I thought the FM radio would not see much use with so many tracks avaiable to me, but its great for tuning in to TV programs at the gym while on the treadmill, concerts and programs being simulcast, NPR, and on and on. 
##When you don't feel like toting a PDA while out for the day (i.e. cycling, window shopping, etc,)simply download everything thru outlook. 
scroll bar[-1] ##I've read about the issues with the scroll bar, but they must have taken care of that now. 
ease of usage[+2][u] ##Mine is as easy to use as the mini without any firmware download. 
size[+2], look[+2] ##Its also smaller, and gets more looks. 
##People are use to seeing so may Ipods, that when they see my Zen, they have to ask questions. 
extra features[+3] ##An extra gig of room, FM radio, voice recorder, PIM applications with sync to Outlook. 
player[+2][p] ##This is really a no brainer. 
##[+][s] ##BUY THE ZEN!"     
[t]
features[+2] ##I purchased this over the Ipod Mini because it had several nice features: extra 1G storage, WMA support, replaceable battery, and especially that it wasn't an Apple product with their proprietary architecture.  
##After using it for a week, I wish I had purchased the Ipod. 
touchpad[-3] ##The Touchpad is virtually unusable -- sometimes you have to press like mad to make a selection and other times the slightest brush causes something to be selected that you don't want. 
##This is by far my biggest complaint.  
download speed[-3] ##Another problem is that the latest 2.0 firmware upgrade moves you into Windows Media Player 10 which seems to be very, very slow for downloads.  charging[-2] ##Also note that it doesn't seem to charge when connected to the PC, only when plugged into an AC socket even though they both connect to the single USB port on the player, so you have to charge the battery separately from downloading music.     
[t]
##... then this might intrigue you greatly.  
##The hook with this MP3 player, distinguishing it from the others, is clearly going to be the OS applications it provides.  
##Finally, someone has figured out that building some smarts into the player will help it compete with iPods.  
##The latest craze for MP3 manufacturers is the 5Gb microdrive, a 25% boost from the 4Gb ones supplied by Hitachi.  
##At this point, the Rio Carbon is 5Gb (along with a host of South Korean manufacturers), and eventually the iPod will get a "free" upgrade to 5Gb as the 4Gb trickle down to nothing.  
##Then what?  
##What compels you to choose one over the other?  
##It has to be the UI and user experience.  
##The Carbon is nice but offers no improvement to the near-perfect iPod experience.  
##The scroll wheel is not an Apple innovation, but it took Apple to put it on their MP3 player for the obvious to become clear to the industry.  
##So tack on a scroll wheel and... you still have to compete against the intuitive OS-based application that an iPod offers the user.  
##It's easy to find songs, organize songs, and also carry some essentials and diversions.  
##The iPod gets it right, the Carbon doesn't.  
##Today, the Creative Zen Micro proves it, too, gets it right.  
Outlook compatibility[+2] ##Better for the Zen Micro is Outlook compatibility. 
##This makes the Zen Micro the first choice for MP3 owners with a Windows-based system.  
##I'm not professing to be a consumer-survey corporation, but I don't know *anyone* with an iTunes account.  
##However, I do know about a dozen people with well over 4000 MP3s each.  
##What device would I recommend?  
##Well, if size matters, and you like the idea of a lime-green or bright yellow device, then I'd have to go with a Creative Zen Micro.  
software[+3], tech support[+2], accessories[+2] ##Creative has excellent music software, a very responsive tech support group (they are quick on firmware updates, and make them publicly available), and usually a good array of accessories.  
additional accesories[+1] ##The Zen Micro is no exception: in addition to the case, it comes with a neck strap, and has all of the necessary cables for syncing and charging.  
extra battery{+2] ##The extra spare battery is just a neat bonus.  
player[+2] ##If I could, I'd trade-up on my Creative Muvo2 and snag a Zen Micro tomorrow.  
##**** I gave up a ton of positive reviews to add this addendum.  
##I do not work for Creative; I had a chance to play with a review copy in-depth, as others have (See Engadget, Gizmodo, or c|net as examples).  
##Just because Amazon doesn't have it to sell doesn't mean the product is unavailable for review.  
##Please judge any review you read -- in any medium, be it here or newspapers or magazines -- by its own merits. ****  Fred

##I already own the Creative Nomad Zen, the 30 gig version.  
##I wanted something more portable, shirt-pocket sized, and something to complement the new Yahoo Music Unlimited site.  
player[+2][p], portability[+2][p], size[+2][p] ##This is a perfect blend to accomplish both tasks.  
##My big Zen has hundreds of CDs on it, but this little player will store my most listened to tunes, or songs Iwant to download for free from the Yahoo site, "test drive", then decide if I want to download permanently into my larger Creative.  
plug in[+2] ##I also own a retail store and this little guy easily plugs into my AUX slot in the store's sound system.  
features[+2], headphones[+2] ##Feature for feature, I find it a very sweet little player; equipped with a higher end headphone system, between this and th larger Zen Ihardly use my home stereo system anymore. 
##And I gave my CD plyaers away in a garage sale.     
[t]
Napster to go compatibility[-3]  ##If you buying this player to use with Napster to Go, wait a while. 
firmware[-3] ##A lot of people are having problems with the firmware update required to use the player for Napster to Go.. The firmware is beta and they are are a lot of bugs in it. 
##Check out message boards on Napster for more info.     
[t]
##if not amazed, I won't go into the kind of detail many people have here, but I do want to say a few things about my experience so far (I've had it about two weeks) with the Zen Micro; 
##these are the things I was curious about when I was shopping around.   
player[+2][p] ##On the whole, I'm quite happy with the purchase.  
sound[+2], storage[+2][u] ##The sound is bright and clear, the ability to store any MP3's (and not just Apple-approved files) is great, and I plan to make use of the storage space and sound recording from time to time.    
look[+3], comfort[+2], weight[+3], interface[+2] ##The device looks very cool, I think (exactly as the photos promise), it's comfortable and lightweight in my jacket pocket, and the interface and controls are easy enough to navigate after a bit of practice.  
srorage[+2] ##No offense to Amazon, but I was able to find one online for just over 200 bucks (I'm sure prices here will continue to sink), and that also seemed quite a good bargain for the amount of storage space.    
##Now the downside:  One of the features that factored into my choice of a Micro!
##instead of an iPod (I know this is a tediously recurring theme in these reviews, but I want to get my two cents in) was the FM radio.  
radio feature[+1] ##I like some local stations, Stern, and NPR, and so the radio seemed like a great option.  
FM reception[-2][u] ##Imagine my disappointment, though, when the Zen Micro proved able to play only the mega-strongest FM signals in my area.  
FM reception[-3][u] ##It seems like you need to park yourself right next to a radio tower for the Micro to pull in a strong sound.  
battery life[-2] ##The battery, as others have said, also seems weaker than Creative suggests.  
##Here's a quote from Creative's web site (hoping to sell additional batteries):   "Carry an extra rechargeable battery for your Zen Micro for an additional 12 hours of nonstop music."  
##Try an additional *six* hours, methinks.  
creative[-2][u] ##Still, that's enough time that I'm still satisfied, if a bit grouchy with Creative's overhyped promises.    
headphones[+1] ##Have not had any issues with the headphones or fragility.  
player[+1][u] As I said, I don't regret the purchase at all.  
##To use a bas!
Zen micro[+2] ##eball metaphor: I was hoping Creative hit a home run here, and I think the Zen Micro is more like a stand-up double.  
player[-1][u] ##Respectable, solid, but not awe-inspiring.          
[t]
##If you're considering an iPod mini or even an iPod, read this.  
##I looked at the market extensively and took a lot of advice before making the big buy here. 
##I wanted a player that had good capacity, construction that can stand up to exercise, good sound quality, good battery life, good looks, compatibility, and a fair price. 
##Tall order, eh? 
sound quality[+2][p], battery life[+2][p], capacity[+2][p], look[+2][p], construction[+2][p], price[+2][p], compatibility[+1][p] ##Actually, the Creative Zen Micro solves all that.  
sound quality[+3] ##Sound quality? Phenomenal. 
sound quality[+][cc], earbuds[+2] ##unarguably better than Apple's, and nice earbuds to boot.  
##Looks? 
##Let's just say it's no coincidence I put "Foxy Lady" on there. 
variety of colors[+3][u] ##Your choice of ten colors in a beatiful package.  
##Capacity? 
##Apple has tried to hide something from you: most people don't actually need more than a few gigs at most. 
storage[+3][u] ##Five gigabytes is plenty for my great albums. 
##(Like I really wanted "Hotel California" anyway.
##)  Construction? 
construction[+3][u] ##Tough as nails. 
construction[+3][u] ##No skips, and it hasn't faltered once (despite your inevitable drop or two.
##)  Compatibility? 
compatibility[+3] ##Flawless. 
##They've partnered with Napster to give you a! free month of the subscription service (read: all the music you want free for thirty days, when you can cancel with all your music safely hidden away.
play WMA[+2] ##) No locked-in proprietary business like Apple; this baby plays WMAs too.  
voice record[+2], player[+][cc] ##The voice recorder is a beautiful add-on; not even necessary, but just an example of why Apple just wants your money and Creative Labs wants to make a better player. 
sound[+3] ##Gets nice sound too. 
FM tuner[+1] ##The FM tuner is just a little spare icing on the cake.  
##And the price? 
##A bargain $200. 
##Do NOT buy Apple. 
##Inferior quality at a higher price (and shoddy reliability) is not quite justified just because they have a better spokesperson.  
player[+3] ##In conclusion, this player is beautiful. 
ease of use[+2], power[+2] ##Power for the tech-savvy, ease of use for the less fortunate. 
player[+2][p] ##But it; you won't regret it.     
[t]
##I must say, after tons of research, I have chosen the right Mp3 player.  
player[+3], functioning[+2][u], touchpad[+2] ##This player is absolutely phenomenal, I haven't had any problems, and if you're worried you will have problems, I suggest buying it at a retail store that has a good return policy but anyways... I find the touch pad very easy to use, and I'm surprised so many people have had problems.  
sound quality[+3][cc] ##The sound quality is superb, much better than that of an iPod, in my opinion.  
radio[+3] ##The radio works excellent in my area, I'm not sure everywhere else.  
software[+2], file transfer speed[+3][u] ##The software is very easy to use, and the transfer is super fast!  
battery[+1], DJ[+2], features[+2] ##I'm not gonna go into the features cause if you're reading this review, you've probably already looked at them, but I must say the DJ feature if Very cool and the removable battery is also a bonus!  
##Mine came with a wall adapter, but it charges when plugged into the computer anyways.  
look[+2][u] ##The blue light also makes this player one of the most fashionable in the market also.  
##Overall I have no complaints, this is jus!
price[+2], player[+3] ##t simply the best player on the market for a really low price, so why look anywhere else?      
[t]
##I've been using iTunes for about a year now with the intention of eventually buying an iPod.  
##That was before the Zen Micro came along.  
player[+3][p] ##I've had it for about a week now and have to say it's one of the best purchases I've ever made.  
look[+3], ease of use[+2], sound quality[+3][cc] ##it's a great looking, easy-to-use device but it's the sound quality which is truly amazing -- far better than my Sony mini-disc player.  
interface[+3], touchpad[+2] ##I have no problems with the touch pad (once the sensitivity is set to low) and the interface is a breeze to use without even looking at the PDF manual.  
##I can't comment on the bundled software as I haven't even looked at it.  
Media player compatibility[+3] ##Why bother when it works perfectly with Media Player 10?  
##As for the problem with locking up mentioned in a previous post, it only seems to happen if the USB cable is unplugged while WMP 10 is still running.  
##I just close the program down first, wait for the message to appear on the Micro, then unplug it. 
##This appears to prevent the lockup issue.  
##The battery life doesn't appear to be any!
battery life[-1][p] ##where close to 12 hours but at least it is replaceable (and they included a second one free).  
battery life[-1][p] ##I would give it about 6 or 7 hours, although it will probably get better after a few charge cycles.  
##This was probably the biggest reason I chose the Micro over an iPod.  
storage[+2] ##The extra Gb is just a bonus.  
headphones[-1] ##The headphones which came with it are mediocre at best but what can you expect from a set of "ear buds".  
##Plug in a decent set or hook it up to a stereo system and prepare to be impressed.  
sound[+3] ##If your looking for a great sounding mini player, you can't go wrong with the Zen Micro.     
[t]
##After much research I decided that the Zen Micro was the best mp3 player for me.  
player[-2][u] ##Unfortunately I was wrong.  
player[-3] ##Within one month, my player completely died. 
touchpad[-3][u], buttons[-3] ##(It had locked up multiple times previously, but always managed to work afterwards) This time, the touch screen wouldn't respond to me and none of the buttons worked. 
working[-3][u] ##So I took out the battery and put it back in again, only to find that it would not work.  
##Frustrated, I exchanged the player only to get another faulty one!  
sound[-3] ##I had the second one for less than two weeks when I noticed a rattling/humming/buzzing sound while music was played.  
##I've tried different headphones, upgrading firmware, using different files and nothing helps.  
customer service[-3] ##I sent Creative customer service 3 emails in which they did not help me one bit and don't seem to even want to help.  
I've heard many good reviews of this product and I wonder if maybe I just had bad luck.  
design[+2] ##It was a good player when it worked and I loved the design.  
player[-3][p] ##It's too bad, though, that !
##I don't want to keep testing my luck.  
##This time I'm going to get something a little more reliable - an iPod mini.     
[t]	       
Zen micro[+2] ##The Creative Zen Micro, at first glance, is a dream come true for all mp3 and music lovers. 
##I absolutely didn't want to by an Ipod. 
##Not because I wanted to go against the grain, but the idea of having to shell out another 100 bucks (after a year) in order to have Apple replace the non-removable battery just turned me off. 
battery[+2][u] ##The Zen offered a great alternative. 
##Now, there are many alternatives to the Ipod, but I wanted a nice design, also, and not some generic looking mp3 player. 
##I wanted something that looked at least almost as good as an Ipod. 
##I saw the Zen, and-BOOM-I bought one for me and one for a family member. 
##What happens follows:       Let's start with the software. 
software[+1] ##It's easy to use, and makes transfering your CD collection to the player a cinch. 
##You can compress the files for more storage space before you start the transfer. 
##The sonic detail at the highest compression rate(64 kbps WMA) is crazy. 
sound quality[+2][u] ##The clarity is unbelievable, which means you can cram almost the full 2,5!
##00 song capacity of the disk without having to worry about the quality of your music (the Zen micro, actually starts off with about 4.7GB after loading the software). 
##When mine died, I had 1,022 songs loaded, but only used a little over 2gb of space. 
sound quality[+2] ##Other mp3 players won't give you the sonic clarity of the Zen at this compression level, so I imagine they won't at lower ones, either. 
##Check the Zen's S/N ratio and DB rating. 
##They're better than the IPOD, plus, there are seven EQ settings (including custom). 
headphones[-3] ##The included headphones suck, so get your own.         
trnasfer[+2] ##Transfering MP3s are a cinch with the included software. 
format[+2] ##The Zen plays mp3, wma and wave formats, which makes it more versatile than the Ipod. 
software[+2] ##The greatest thing about the software (in my humble) is that it reads your CD info. 
##and labels it before you burn the CD into the Zen. 
organization[+2][u] ##Track #, name, artist, album and genre is automatically-retrieved via internet-labeled, and properly catergorized into the Zen. 
##This feature wo!
labling[+3] ##rks almost without fail, no matter what your taste in music is: From relaxation music to hard rock, to hip hop, to Korean and Japanese, to Afro-Cuban and Salsa, Jazz, Blues, Country and Pop, this feature performs well. 
##Just check the menu on your Zen, and it's all there, and neatly stored. 
##At least, that is, while it's still alive.        
touch screen[-1] ##The touch sreen navigation will take a little getting used to, but once you do, and while the Zen is still alive, it's a great alternative to the marching in lock step with the click wheel commies. 
##It's a tad too sensitive for a first time user (my family member, however, had no problem with it), and it drove me nuts at first. 
##A trick I used was to manually capitalize all the info. 
##going into the Zen from my computer, so my stubby, clumsy fingers could cordinate better with my color blind, near, far and mid sighted eyes. 
##Once I did this, visions of burning my CDs-literally-dance around my head, and all was right in the world (of course, I would have backed my files up, silly). 
##The features this thing has are !
FM reception[-2][u] ##just too numerous to list: FM radio, which has weak reception, but at least it there, and a microphone, to name just two. 
touchpad light[+2][u] ##Oh, and another is the cool "halo" light that surrounds the touch pad, and light's up when you touch the screen, and how the light glows when the Zen is connected to the computer. 
design[-2] ##But, the Creative Zen Micro is plagued by a serious, serious stupid and elemenatary design flaw, and I'm going to tell you what it is...But first, two more things about this piece of garbage that's so great and could've made it a potenial IPOD killer.         
size[+][cc], storage[+][u][cc] ##One: It's size: It's smaller than the Ipod Mini, and holds more music (5GB to the IPOD mini's 4GBs). 
##It's smaller, in most cases than the palm of your hand, and is ergonomically curved. 
##I loved this thing. 
##I've had Dell Pocket DJ owners, IPOD mini AND Shuffle owners marvel at this thing. 
##It cost less than, in most cases, $190. 
battery[+1] ##Two: it has a removeable/rechargeable battery, so you don't have to send the thing in when the re!
##chargeable battery runs out; thereby, waiting 3 weeks to get it back, and possibly with all of your music erased.        
design[-3] ##But, all of this means nothing, because of the serious, serious, stupid and ridiculously elemenatary design flaw: After 3 months, give or take a few weeks, you won't be able to hear anything. 
##Why? 
headphone jack design[-3] ##because the "engineers" at Creative screwed up the design of the headphone jack. 
##It's an admitted design flaw that the people at Creative have acknowledged (google it). 
##There are bulletin boards and customer reviews all over the web talking about it. 
##If you send in your Zen to have the flaw fixed, you lose all of the music you've been loading into the thing for 2-3 months, which came out to 1022 songs and 80 albums for me.       
headphone jack[-3] ##Again, the headphone jack on this thing is garbage. 
##It comes loose after 3 months-give or take-of careful use. 
##Using right angled jacks on your headphones, which minimizes the movement of the headphones while plugged in, won't alleviate the problem. 
##I used them. 
headphone design[-3] ##Again, this is a design flaw in the headphone!
##jack that Creative has acknowledge. 
##I know what you are thinking. 
##You once had a cheap CD player (or walkman) that had the same problem, and you just used miniture screwdrivers to push the left/right prongs out. 
##If only only it was that simple. 
Zen[-2] ##The flaw is inside the Zen. 
##You can't see it by looking into the jacks where the prongs are. 
headphone jack[-2] ##The flaw is in the circuit board that the headphone jack is connected to. 
##In other words, you have to do almost the equivalent of open heart surgery in order just to see where the problem is.           
##There are do it yourself sites (with pictures)that show you how to repair it, but keep in mind that you will have to break the warranty seal, which means? ##Exactly, warranty voided. 
##So, if you don't won't to void your warranty, you will have to get in touch with Creative, they will send you a rma number, fix your Zen, but you lose all of your dogon music. 
Zen micro[-3] ##The Creative Zen Micro is a Zen Micro killer, not an Ipod killer. 
##Do your research; check !
##out the bulletin boards.     
[t]
storage[-][cc] ##Why would anyone buy this when you can get a 20GB iPod that will hold 4 times the number of songs (and even MORE if AAC encoding is used) for the same price???  
##In addition , iPods can be used as portable hard drives and can display your calendars and contact info.      
[t]
audio quality[+3], ease of use[+3], features[+3] ##This player is fantastic in terms of audio quality, ease of use, and features. 
##However, if you are considering purchasing one to use with subscription music services like Napster-to-go, or Yahoo Music Unlimited, there are a few things to keep in mind:  1. 
usage with subscription service[-2][u] ##To use the Creative Zen player with a subscription service, you need to go to Creative's web site, and download new software for your PC. 
##You will also need to download and install new firmware on the player. 
##At the time of this writing, that firmware is a "beta release." 
set up[-1] ##I haven't seen any problems yet, but if you don't like to tinker a bit, this player can be a little challenging to set up.  
##2. 
transfer speed[-2] #Right now, the Creative software transfers subscription music files very slowly. 
##It makes USB 2.0 feel like USB 1.1. 
subscription WMA[-1] ##This doesn't affect standard MP3 files - just subscription WMA files. 
##The solution? 
##Use Windows Media Player 10 to do your transferring. 
transfer speed[-1][u] ##The subscription files are still a little slower to transfer, but it's only by about 10% or so.  
##3. 
##Subscription files need to buffer when you first hit "play," so there's a 4-7 second delay before the first song starts. 
##However, once an album is playing, there's no gap between songs. 
##The player intelligently pre-buffers the next song. 
subscription DRM-encoded[-1] ##Again, this doesn't affect regular MP3 files - just subscription DRM-encoded files, like those from Napster-to-Go or Yahoo Music Unlimited.  
##These issues knock a single star off the review. 
player[+1] ##Otherwise, this is a great "alternative" MP3 player for those of use who don't want to worship the mighty all-powerful Apple. 
player[+2][p] ##I got it to use with the new $5-per-month service from Yahoo (Music Unlimited,) and despite the above issues, I love it. 
##The subscription service lets me download as much as I want, and the player lets me take it wherever I go.     
[t]
##Nobody has clearly articulated what exactly about the Ipod mini makes it better than this product.  
##I have visited multiple websites, and for virtually EVERY new hard-drive-based mp3 player I find, there are always user reviews that smash the new player and say something like "Just go buy an Ipod!"  
##Apple apparently has built up a very nice following of brainwashed consumers.  
##It is unlikely that you will EVER get the best products just by sticking with one company.  
##What is the conjunctive probability that each successive product release will be without flaws or that the company isn't having turnover in the R&D department (or making bad management decisions)?  
##Apple never was involved with a lot of audio products until the Ipod.  
creative[+3] ##I have owned some kind of Creative audio product since 1993 and have never had to call tech support.  
##Of course, some were better than others, and I probably could have gotten a better sound card from another company at some point.  
player[+3][p] ##The main issue now is that this new Zen Micro seems to be the best on the market at least temporarily.  
interface[+2][cc], storage[+2][cc], battery life[+2][cc] ##It beats Apple on the storage space, it beats apple on the removable battery (and batter life), and I personally like its interface more than the Ipod scroll wheel.  
audio quality[+][cc] ##Further, the tech specs suggest that it has better audio quality than the Ipod.  
##It may be that the next Creative product is complete junk, but you should make product decisions based on product attributes NOW, not based on a halo effect of an idealized company (Apple) or other pointless loyalties.       
[t]	 
player[+3][p] ##I have had several MP3 players over the past few years, and have to say that this by far is the best that I've owned. 
##(The others include: the Intel Pocket Concert, the Archos Jukebox, which was returned after three or four faulty units...I'm extremely patient, and the Creative Labs Nomad Jukebox 3.
##) A previous reviewer has mentioned several different issues with the 'Zen Micro'. 
##However, their player seems to be defective and Creative Labs should be contacted before making such harsh statements if they haven't been contacted already.  
##I must say that there are several factors that influenced my purchase. 
##An Apple Ipod Mini was considered. 
features[+3][cc] ##However, the Ipod does not come close to the number of extra features that the 'Zen Micro' has to offer.   
storage[+3][u], battery life[+3], extra features[+2][u] ##Some features that the 'Zen Micro' has that sold me on my purchase include: a 5G hard drive...actually an SD flash card drive...very large and much more than actually needed, the ability to sync with Microsoft Outlook's calendar, the long battery life of about 10 to 12 hours (I can change the battery myself for about $40 to buy vs. 
construction[+3], sound quality[+3], microphone[+2] ##sending the unit to the company of purchase which costs about $90), the ability to record with a built-in microphone (great for recording reminders and meetings), very sturdy construction, and not to mention...the sound quality is excellent!  
user interface[+3] ##As far as user interface is concerned, the best and easiest to use seems to be the one that comes with the player, 'Creative MediaSource Organizer'. 
##It comes with a built-in program simply entitled 'Creative MediaSource Audio Converter'. 
converter[+2] ##This program enables the user to batch convert and convert audio files from one format to another. 
formats[+3][u], ##These include: MP3, Wave, WMA, WMA Pro, and WMA Lossless; it is very user-friendly simply by right-clicking the file(s) to be converted. 
Creative zen Micro[+3][p] ##By far this seems to be the best value out there for the money; if you are undecided, the Creative Zen Micro seems to be the best choice.     
[t]
on[-3], off[-3] ##I don't know, maybe I got a defective one but first, the player would not shut off, next, the player would not come on - I had to send it away to get repaired.  
ear phone jack[-3] ##Now, the player's ear phone jack is not working - I have to send it away again.  
player[+1][p] ##When it's working, it's great but it is very tempermental.   
[t]
phone[+3][u]##I've had this beauty for nearly 2 months now and I truely love it.
battery life[-2]##The only disappointment so far has been battery life.
battery life[-2][u]##Mine generally requires a charege every 48 hours or so and I don't really talk on it that much.
##Why is this phone so great?
##Simple.
phone[+3][p]##It has it all.
phone[+3]##This is the first phone I know of that has the large bright screen, infrared, bluetooth, USB connector and a speakerphone.
phone[+3]##If you are looking for an upgrade, this is definitely the phone for you.
[t]
##I got this with the need for a nokia GSM camera-phone with speakerphone.
size[cs][+2]##3660 had similar features, but that is big in size.
6600[+3]##6600 looks and feels nice.
bluetooth[+3]##This one is full of features(has bluetooth).
LCD[+3]camera quality[+3]##Especially the LCD is big and the camera quality is among the very best around.
PDA[+3]##I have set up it's PDA features with avantgo.com where you can download info from sites like weather,mapquest maps/directions into it, which is great.
s/w[+3]##Using supplied s/w, you can transfer all addresses from a different nokia phone into it.
battery life[+3][u]##Goes ~3 days after a charge.
[t]
##Its been 11 months now that I've held on to my Nokia 6600 for.
phone[-1][cs]##I purchased this phone knowing it was slightly old as compared to the newer models of Nokia phones available.
priced[-2]##I thought it was kind of steeply priced at that time.
phone[+3]##I must add to the dismay/delight of readers this phone is simply the most groundbreaking phone mankind has ever held.
use[+3]##It has raised the bar owing to number of features it offers and the absolute ease of use delight.
##Now I'm a techy and like getting technical about things so I'd brief you in on the few features I liked about this phone-
keypad[+3]##1.The Phone has the best keypad any Nokia phone has to offer.
##My dad has a Nokia 6670 before which he has a Nokia 7210 and before that he had a Nokia 6610.
##I think the keypad on your cell phone is the most important thing for me as Im constantly sending messages , calling people and fiddling around with my phone.
keypad[+3][cc]##Believe me when I say this I have used and fingered all Nokia phones and the 6600 has the best keypad
##2. The looks are absolutely no nonsensical.
##Some complain it being a tad too bulky looking.
look[+2]##I must admit its not the best looking phone ever but then it has this look of static and absolute conviction that looks like everything a phone should be
interface[+3]##3. The Nokia 6600 has a brilliant Java interface.
##There's a whole lot of things you can do with this phone besides reading a book , playing various Java games , having a variety of software installed.
MMC card[+3][u]##The Phone offers a 32 Mb MMC card and I think that is certainly the most exciting feature.
##I upgraded mine to a 128 MB MMC Card via which I can store unlimited number of messages, take a thousand pictures and videos.
Capacity[+3]##Capacity is not a problem here.
Build[+3]##4. The Build is just right.
sturdy[+3][u]##The phone is sturdy.
build[+3][u]##I've dropped it atleast a dozen times to my recolletion and it still works as good as ever.
phone[+3][u]##Its a tough one this unless you wanna drive your car over it.
phone[+3][u]##This isn't the most rugged phone ever but then your not gonna play aeroplane with this,are you.
Camera[+3]##5.The Camera installed on this phone is awesome.
bluetooth[+3]##I click pictures in JPG format and because the phone has a bluetooth device I find it extremely easy to transfer pics to my pc and forth.
display[+3][u]##The display and brightness on this phone is quite extraordinary.
colors[+3]##The use of 65536 (16bit) colors ensures you get your share of animations and icons on your phone
##Besides the above mentioned Merits , the phone has decent ear volume and loudspeaker functionality.
upgradibility[+3]##It has great upgradibility.
##I can play MP3 files on my phone by simply downloading softwares freely available on the net.
##Now that is neat.
log[+3]##The log functions helps you track down the incoming , outgoing calls in the most easy of ways.
handsfree[+3]##The handsfree provided by the phone is useful for those who talk on the phone while driving.
##I wouldn't do that because it's not worth my life.
processor[-3]ear volume[-2][cs]##Anyhow some demerits of this phone, The phone has a slow processor and the ear volume is lower than 6610 but then the 6610 has the best ear volume among most Nokia variants.
battery life[-2]##The battery life of this phone is at most 2 days and at least one day at excessive use.
Video recording[-2]##Video recording is limited at just 9 seconds.
upgrade[-1][u]##You can upgrade but then there's a certain level of trouble involved.
##Overall I dont think I will ever upgrade from this phone.
##When I purchased this phone , I thought to myself that I had purchased the most popular phone around and the thought didn't please me.
##In any case , putting aside how common it is in my city , I dont think I can be anymore satisfied.
phone[+3]##This makes for a great phone.
##Did I mention the note feature and how you can send notes via Bluetooth?
##gee anyways ENJOY WHAT WORKS!
[t]
phone[-3]##I've had Nokia's for years, and while this one is packed with whiz bang features it is disappointing for its primary use - a phone.
##Before buying, I'd urge you to actually use one and not just handle it in the store.
phone[-3]##On the plus side it's packed with features, including BlueTooth that works fine - it's really a tiny computer that is also a phone... and that's the negative.
screen[-3][u]##As a computer, or PDA its weak since the screen, while large by phone standards, is still tiny to really do anything on.
##And remember, this is a PHONE first and foremost which is where I have my biggest complaints...
dial[-3]##When you dial a number, you'll need to check the screen to see that the number entered is correct.
keys[-3]##You'll do that because the keys are tightly packed in and your fingers will likely press two keys at once.
screen[-3][u]##I hope you have a magnifying glass, because the number displayed as well as most of the pop up options are tiny.
screen[-3]##It's as though Nokia has segregated 90% of the screen for fancy features rarely used and leave just 10% for the day to day use.
phone[-3]##I've have many Nokia's and while this is the best for features, it's the worst as a phone.
##Sorry, try something else or at least trying using one.
##You'll see what I mean ... if you have a magnifying glass.
[t]
feels[+2],bluetooth[-2]##This phone is flashy and feels good in the hand, but it could not hold a connection to any of my bluetooth devices (headset, handheld, or desktop computer).
phone[-2][cc]##My old Siemens s56, on the other hand, worked beautifully with all of the above.
[t]
##Don't get me wrong.
##I love gadgets, technology and whatever electronic equipment you throw my way.
##I've gone from almost every Nokia phone since they were only known and operational in Europe.
##In those days I've gone from Oki, Motorolla and progressed (actually regressed) to Sony Ericsson's T610.
##Now I'm back to Nokia to try their 6600 model.
[t]
camera[-3]##who in the hell needs a frigging *VGA* camera on their CELLPHONE???
##What is that, .00000001 megapixel quality?
##Ha!
[t]
##i bought this phone last march, almost a year ago, in saudi arabia (it came out there before it did here).
phone[+3][p]##since then, i have not found one major problem with it.
camera[+3]PDA[+3]##i highly recommend it if you are looking for a phone with great camera quality and/or lots of features you would find in a PDA.
[t]
bulky[-1][u],features[+3][p]##Sure, it is a relatively bulky, but it is really packed with many great features.
bluetooth[+3]transfer[+3]##I own this phone for about 6 months now, I have used the following features: bluetooth connection to laptop and desktop for sync contacts and calendars with Outlook, transfer files (movies, songs), I have many movies on it now with a 512MB memory card that it takes.
##Bought a bluetooth headset and it works like a wonder.
Handsfree[+2]##Handsfree future is good, but not too exciting.
Camera[+2],video recording[-1]##Camera is nice, and video recording for some reason is only limited to 9 seconds.
slow[-2],bluetooth[-2]##Only thing I don't like about it is slow in changing apps, boot up, and sometime it has problem connect thru bluetooth.
[t]
looking[+2]##This one has a good looking.
look[+2][u]##It's oval and... nice.
shape[+2],keypad[+2],joystick[+2]##I like it's shape and it's keypad and joystick.
use[+3],small[+3][u]##It's easy to use. Not too small, and not too big.
screen[+2]##The screen is quite big (between all handphone), but the just about 65000 color.
camera[-2]##And, other else,  the camera is still VGA.
slow[-2][p]##I must say, this one is quite slow to open an application.
phone[-2][p]##Sometimes, it needs few minutes to open an application.
##What's wrong with it?
##Is it really slow, or what?
phone[+2][p]##Few month ago, it's very popular among my community.
phone[+2][p]##It's good.
phone[-1][p]##But not good enough for me.
color[+3]##:! OK, score 7.0 Oh yes, the newest color of this phone is quite cool.
[t]
Nokia[-2][cc]##I have overall been disappointed with Nokia in the past, finding that Samsung and Motorola tended to have better quality phones.
6600[+2][cc]##While this phone obviously doesn't have the same quality construction as Motorola does, the Nokia 6600 is one of the better phones I've used.
versatility[+3]features[+3]##What makes it so great is the versatility and the number of features it has.
##The best features that I use most often are:
audio quality[+3]##1) Great audio quality overall.
audio quality[+3]##Handset quality is great, as is the speakerphone quality and the headset audio quality.
##2) Camera phone.
camera[+3]##A decent camera phone for taking quick pictures, movies, and having general all around fun with.
joystick[+3]##3) The joystick design they are using on the new Nokias gives you a great degree of control.
joystick[-2]##The only problem is that occasionally the joystick does start to dig into your thumb while gaming.
ring tone[+3],game[+3]##4) One nice thing about Nokias is that they have a ton of ring tone and game choices.
Nokia[+3]##If you love your cell phone games or changing your ring tones everyday, Nokia beats everyone else.
Bluetooth[+3]##5) Bluetooth wireless technology, so that I can transfer data to and from my computer without messing with any cables.
##This is great for putting photos and memos on the computer and transferring calander data to my phone.
wide[+2][u]##6) The phone is really wide, which seems to be a turnoff for many people, but the phone is actually easier to grip and feel more ergonomic.
small[+3][u]##I feel much less likely to drop this phone than others, which are actually starting to get too small.
[s]##You will probably have to get a belt clip for it, however, unless you wear the pants with the cargo pockets.
construction[-2]##My biggest concern is that I have found Nokia phones lower quality construction to lead to lower prices, but they also don't last as long.
construction[+1][u]##I can tell using the phone that it feels a little flimsier than Motorolas do, but as long as I'm not planning on dropping the phone or running over it with my car it should be just fine.
[s]##I wouldn't use it for business purposes and hand one out to all my employees, because you tend to want a little more rugged a phone for that.
phone[+3]##Other than that it meets or surpasses all of my needs and surely won't disappoint any already established Nokia phone fans.
[t]
interface[-2]##OPERATION: It's like BMW's I-Drive - It does it's job, but has the most unintuitive, overly-layered interface.
##For example, the memory card is under the battery.
operation[-2][u]##The phone must be shut down & taken apart to change the memory card... and turning the phone back on takes a little while.
##This is representative of the entire phone operation.
##Not for the impatient.
##If you've never used an advanced mobile phone before, you might assume this is par for the course, but it simply isn't.
instruction booklet[-2]##Even the instruction booklet is out of order.
applications[+2]##APPLICATIONS: It has lots of applications and they work very well... when you eventually find where they are and they finally open.
applications[-2]##No matter how accustomed to the phone you become, too much time is required to get to, open and close applications.
##On the other hand, one may leave many applications open at once, hide them and return to them just where they left off - similar to a Mac.
##Me likes.
6600[+2][u]##The 6600 has more ameneties than most - World phone, Camera (VGA/zoom/night mode/timer), Video (w/ audio & zoom), Speaker (good sound), Bluetooth, infrared, Modem for computers, electronic wallet, Internet access, Calendar, calculator, converter and more.
phone[-2][u]##The phone does not have an Mp3-player, FM radio, 200k+ color screen, megapixel camera, quad band, PDA, photo editor.
##I'm not sure that a phone w/ these and all of the above features exists just yet. ...I'm not sure I'd want to spend THAT much time w/ a device, anyhow.
DEPENDABILITY[+3]##DEPENDABILITY: I've seen no glitches.
phone[+3][u]##I've had no problems w/ this phone.
keys[-2][u]##STYLING/ERGONOMICS: The keys are small, which generally doesn't bother me if they are spaced because I can employ a little 'Braille,' but the keys run into each other, so careful attn. must be paid when dialing.
##As for appearance, well, that's subjective.
##Few will look at the phone and know it's 'all that'.
stylized[-2][u]##It's not as stylized as a Sony or Samsung.
##Less Benz/obvious; more Audi/understated.
big[+2][u]##Although it has chubby hips, the device isn't really so big.
screen[+3]##Solid, squeak-free, large screen.
MEMORY[+3]##MEMORY/STORAGE - Seemingly boundless.
memory[+3]##First of all, the phone houses a great deal of memory for multiple videos, sound clips, photos, texts, etc.
transmission[+3]##Secondly, all info can be sent to a computer and w/o the hassle of USB wires.
##Still not sure?
##If you max out the phone memory and have sent all you wish to a computer, there is a memory card w/ a good deal of storage as well.
##This is no small deal.
##If you're still whining about storage, deleting some games will free-up still more memory.
##RECEPTION: This really depends on locale & carrier.
6600[+3],mhz[+3]##The 6600 (T-Mobile) is the true 'world phone' in that it has the mhz to operate around the globe, including New Zealand and Australia (900) whereas the  6620 (available from Cingular) replaces it w/ 800mhz (some refer to as 850).
coverage[+3][u]##The latter will provide better coverage in more remote areas of The States but still operates in many countries, excluding New Zealand and Australia.
6600[-2],service[-1]##The 6600 will provide similar service in more developed areas of The States and not as well in more remote areas.
6600[+3]##As the 6600 uses 900mhz, it operates in more countries than the 6620.
battery life[+1]##The battery life is less than stellar, but it charges w/ the quickness.
operating system[+3]##Remember, this phone uses an operating system - Symbian... and it's feature-rich w/ 65k colors.
video[+3]##It films 10 second video, for crying out loud.
battery life[-1]##The battery life can't be very long; let's not be greedy.
##GAMES - Java.
game[-3]##Don't use them, so I delete them for addtl space.
##In my humble opinion, games, along w/ 'flip phones' belong in the hands of teenagers.
[s]##IMP: Two important pieces of advice - Visit Nokia's site.
downloads[+3]##There are number of downloads needed/available for this phone & they will be texted to you at no cost.
##The downloads are for basic and advanced operations.
[s]##The second piece of advice - Be prepared to spend a lot of time w/ this phone.
##If you expect to be able to pick things up when you're out and in a rush via common sense, many times you'll end up frustrated.
phone[+2][cc]##A Sony Ericcson may be the phone for you... but good luck finding one w/ all the features & such a competitive price.
[s]##Keep in mind that for nearly every screen, there are a number 'along side' and 'beneath' them... for every 'save,' there are choices of phone memory, memory card or sim card.
phone[+3]##Despite a critical start, this phone deserves four stars because it accomplishes what it sets out to do (which is pretty lofty)... does more than most... does it well... is dependable.
##It's a high-line Audi, on a Cadillac suspension, at a reasonable price.
phone[-2]##When you consider expandability (downloads via computer), the numerous features, two transmission programs and multiple storage devices, dependability - this is a phone that isn't easy to out-grow.
[u]##I would suggest this phone for all but the simple-minded... or those who simply don't need so many features.

##*****DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE***** ****READ WHY****
##In October of 2003, I bought a Nokia 3650 off of eBay.
##It was an OK phone with a really nice screen, great battery life, decent signal, and cool applications.
##It was a major step up from a Sony t68i.
##The 3650--being essentially a mini-computer--had memory leaks and occassional crashing, but nothing that a quick power cycle couldn't help.
##Most importantly, it allowed me to get on the Internet via Bluetooth via GPRS flawlessly.
##It's a nice phone, and I'm glad to have used it.
##In July of 2004, I purchased a Nokia 6600 from T-Mobile.
##Since I use my Palm PDA and T-Mobile offers unlimited Internet, I asked the sales representative if I could use this phone as a Bluetooth modem for my Palm, and he said yes.
##So I bought the phone and went on my merry way.
BLUETOOTH[-3]##BLUETOOTH DOES NOT WORK ON THIS PHONE.
##THE ADVERTISING IS A LIE.
Bluetooth[-3]##Though nearly a dozen different people at both T-Mobile and Nokia have told me otherwise, it is simply not possible to use this phone as a Bluetooth modem for the vast majority of PDAs and many other devices.
##While the two devices will pair, the phone will immediately drop the connection if any data is transferred.
##With the recent "bluejacking" vunerability, the Bluetooth overseers have created a new security system called Combination Key.
##This helps prevent people from sending short "obscene" messages to your phone.
##The older security method is called Unit Key.
##Most Bluetooth devices only support the older security system, Unit Key.
##This includes ALL Palm PDAs! Further, due to an unparalled design oversight, Nokia is the only device that supports Combination Key that is NOT BACKWARDS COMPATIBLE with the older devices that people actually own.
##Does all this sound technical?
##That's because it is, and the only way I learned it was by spending over an hour talking to T-Mobile's tier-3 technicians in South Africa (to learn that the problem wasn't about T-Mobile) and three hours of getting nowhere with Nokia support technicians reading endlessly from scripts, never deviating, until I started cursing and got a tier-2 tech.
PHONE[-3]##Only then did I learn the truth -- THIS PHONE DOES NOT WORK WITH PALM PDAS!
##So, after all this frustration of adding all of my newest contacts to the 6600, I asked the technician if it were possible to transfer the data from the 6600 to the 3650.
##He advised me to back up the 6600 to a newly formatted Nokia MMC card, and restore the data to the 3650.
##I followed the technician's directions to the letter while they were on the phone, and after I had done so, the phone restarted and displayed the message "Phone startup failed. Contact the retailer."
##I spent over an hour talking to a tier-2 technician who told me that their tier-1 technician should have known that it was not possible to backup the 6600 to the 3650 safely in any condition.
##I could not get the 3650 working to even factory defaults, even after trying every reset code they could muster.
##Nokia finally determined that my phone was in need of repair, but since it was out of warranty (it was made in May '03 and they would not take an eBay purchase as proof) they refused to fix the phone for less than $120!
##After over two hours of being placed on hold and persuasion, a supervisor finally agreed to fix the phone for free.
##I did a little research and discovered that the repair could be done by any basic cell-phone for $30.
##All that had to be done was restore the software to the phone, and all that took was a cable and some Nokia software.
##I still decided to send in the phone, since insured shipping was only $10.
##Two weeks later I mailed the phone in for repair.
##Two days after they received the phone, I received a letter in my mailbox stating that if I did not pay $120 for the repair of my phone, it would be returned unrepaired.
##I called Nokia to try to get it sorted out, and they stated that they had no recollection of ever promising to repair the phone for free.
##They stated that though it was a simple repair they would not do it for less than $120.
##I suggested that it didn't make sense for me to send in the phone for repair if I thought Nokia would charge me $120 to repair it since I could get it done locally for $30.
nokia[-3]##This simple nuance was too much for Nokia, and they still refuse to acknoledge the fact that their technician could have broken the phone or repair the phone for free.
##The supervisor stated that it must have been third-party applications on the 6600 that caused the 3650 to break, and would not take the suggestion that his own tier-2 technicians stated that it was not possible to back up the 6600 to the 3650 without damaging the 3650, regardless of what was or was not on the 6600.
Nokia[-3]##In short - Nokia themselves don't know that this phone doesn't work with the Palm, and if you don't heed my advice you will spend hours with technicians around the globe reading from scripts, chiding you in broken english for not following their directions exactly.
##You will also hard-reset both your Palm and your Nokia to factory defaults in their lame attempts to get the script to work, though it will not.
Nokia[-3]##Ultimately you will learn just how bad Nokia is, and why their recent loss of market share is so utterly deserved.
[t]
##The title pretty much says it all.
photos[-3]##The photos in the address book are terribly scaled too; they look as though they were built out of legos.
[t]
phone[+3]##This phone is one of the best I've ever used.
phone[+3][p]##It has everything I needed: bluetooth, infrared, support for MMC, camera, and a good operating system with lots of supporting software.
[t]
phone[+2][cs]##I would have given this phone 5 stars if it wasn't for the fact that I would rather use my 3330 to do all the most common things you do with a phone.
interface[-3]##It's important that people know the following:  First, the interface is slow.
interface[-3][u]##You hit the message button on the front and it takes a matter of SECONDS to bring up the menu.
##Same with the contacts list, recent call list and everything else.
lag[-3],useable[-2]##Secondly, in addition to the lag each time you give a command, it's just not that easily useable on the go.
number buttons[-3],fonts[-1],interface[-2]##The number buttons are crammed into a 3x4cm area, the fonts are small, the interface is too convoluted and frustrating, it's not that customisable as well.
look[+3],battery life[+3],memory[+3]##The plusses are the features, look, good signal and battery life, memory size and robustness.
camera[+2],video[+2]##The camera and video functionality is decent, I can't see myself wasting my time with it, but some people will.
[s]##All in all I would say wait for the cell phone companies to create a PDA/cell hybrid that is efficient and easy to use as a phone.
[t]
phone[+3]##this is a great phone i have this phone since Feb 04 and i never have any problem at all.
features[+3],camera[+3],ringtones[+3],bluetooth[+3]##very cool features... great camera with zoom...cool quality pictures... great ringtones... bluetooth feature is great....
[t]
##I have purchased two of these phones together from the Amazon market place.
[s]##If you are purchasing this phone, then make sure you can handle the speed of this phone.
phone[-3][u]##This phone is not suitable for fast people, maybe only for old people.
slow[-3][u]##The menu pops up after 3 seconds The picture takes a while to load from its slow card memory.
time[-3][u]##The navigation takes so much time that it would eventually drive you crazy.
##Its like having a 66Mhz computer with a webcam, fax, printer, blue tooth...etc...Just an example..
##I bet most of the users of this phone would agree.
##Sometimes,the phone gets stuck just like a computer and it doesnt store any incoming call numbers..etc..
[s]##If you find a better phone, then I suggest you go for it.
[t]
big[-2][u]##At first glance, I thought this phone was a little too big for me, maybe a little too complicated.
##One minute with the salesman and I was sold.
phone[+3][p]##This thing does everything but washes your dishes.
modem[+3][p]##I can use it as a modem for my computer, connect with clients and friends, the possibilities are endless.
ringtones[+3],screen[+3]##The ringtones are beautiful, the screen is super high quality.
##I could go on and on---but I won't!
##Go see for yourself.
##The ONLY bad thing?
carrier[-3]##I can NOT find a carrier for this phone I like, end up just tossing it in my purse.
[t]
phone[+3]##I do not need to repeat what's great about this phone.
##A few things that I want to suggest for improvements:
##1) phone card calling feature.
Phone card calling[-3]##This phone doesn't include Phone card calling.
##So you have to dial your phone card access number, PIN card, and choose "send touch tone" and find your contact from the address book.
phone card calling[-3]##This process can be very annoying and unsafe when you are driving a stick shift on the highway.
##For phone card with PIN Free dialing setup, you are a little bit lucky.
##All you need to do is to choose your "phone card" contact and then "send touch tone" and choose the contact.
##This feature is very important to me as I make a lot of international calls.
feature[-3][cc]##My old Sony Ericsson T610 has this feature.
##All I need to do is to choose the contact and in option select "calling card call".
##2) Low volume on regular answering.
hear[-3][u]##In noisy environment, it's hard to hear from the earpiece.
##You have to use speaker or handsfree, to get larger volume.
volume[-3][u]##Speaker volume is loud and clear but it sacrifaces the battery life.
[t]
##Most of thew reviews are high for this phone ......
##My explanation is that most of the reviewers are americans that live in the states .....
##the difference is : until recently there have been no GSM networks in a wide scale , so most cell network companies supplied consumers with cells , we in the middle east (for example) have stopped using years ago ....
##So no wonder a lot of people find the 6600 such a miracle .
##I have purchased the 6600 when it was first released in The Middle East , almost a month before Europe , and reading the brochures and features , it really did sound like a true all-in-one functionality monster .
phone[-3][p]##Unfortunately , I sold it exactly a month later .
volume[-3]##1-A cell phone is to make CALLS , in other words , quality of reception and mic/speaker are the most important , the 6600 has a relatively low volume speaker , you'd have to press it hard against your ear to hear anything the other person is saying , unless the surroundings were completely quiet .
bulky[-3][u],buttons[-3]##2- It is bulky and the small buttons on the sides are sloppy to use .
SLOW[-3][cs]##3- It is SLOW , if you keep the original configuration and progs (why'd u buy it then ?!) it'll run smoothly , but still slower than most other coloured-screen Nokias .
##As soon as you copy video/audio files and add some programs and games , it WILL hang at least 5-10 times a day.
##A firmware upgrade is irrelevant .
phone[-3]##4- My idea was that it was an all-in-one , and that theory -once again- proves wrong , this phone excells at nothing , less  than average in everything , if you seriously need any of the "other than phone" functionalities , you'll be disappointed .... if you have lots of money and bought it for the love of gadgets then fine .... but don't expect to get much done .
##5- If you already have a girlfriend and/or wife , you won't need Bluetooth lol .
features[-3]##Basically the 6600 is a bundle of over-hyped features you don't and won't need (if you do get yourself a PDA or pocket PC) , none of them work as they should , and the basic phone functions and ergonomics are less than average .
phone[-3][cs]##I'm an advocate of Nokia , but this phone and the following models (7610) , are seemingly a desperate trial at squeezing as much under-engineered and experimental technologies in one sloppy phone .
phones[-3][cs]##I'm giving it 1 star because as compared to other Nokia phones , its a 1 , compared to other blunders by other companies (such a samsung and motorrola) it might be good .... but if you're getting a Nokia , don't get this one .
[t]
##I bought this phone a few months ago and I have been using it since then.
phone[+3][u]##I never had a single problem.
menu[+3]##It is Nokia and thus easy to acces the menu options.
video[+3],pictures[+3]##High quality video and pictures rock!
band[+3]##3 band and you can just change the SIM card in it to be able to use it in Europe with another service provider.
phone[+3]##Bottom line great phone for the time being.
[t]
color TFT display[+3][u],camera[+3],video[+3]##I use a Nokia 6600, it has a great color TFT display and camera equipped with zoom, which complement a built-in video recorder with audio and a RealOne player for playback and streaming of 3GPP-compatible and RealMedia video clips.
Multimedia functions[+3]##Multimedia functions are enhanced by multi-slide MMS messages and a Gallery for organizing digital content captured or downloaded with the phone.
##So, do I recommend the 6600?
[s]##Yes, certainly.
##But if you are in the market for a new business capable phone, and don't want to deal with a stylus equipped PDA like device such as the P900, then the 6600 will probably suit you just fine.
6600[+3]##The Nokia 6600 is a decent extension of the smartphone line.
keypad[+3],display[+3][u],rundown time[+3][u],software[+3]##The phone has such advantages as the excellent keypad and display, long rundown time and a good software suite.
MMC slot[-2],design[-2]##Among its weak points is the MMC slot location and a bit vague design.
6600[+2]##In short, the Nokia 6600 is an evolution but not a revolution.
[t]
multimedia[+3]##I'm sure you can read the specs above to see everything it does, but for me the best thing is that I can easily check my email, movie times, news, or any website with this phone.
picture[+3]##You can take pic of your friends and the picture will pop up when they call.
ringtone[+3]##Give each friend a different ringtone.
rings[+3],themes[+3]##Get great themes and wallpapers for this phone and many many polyphonic rings.
screen[+3]##A huge beautiful color screen which can not been scratched at all even with the rough handling i give it.
Nokia[+3],phones[+3]##Nokia makes great phones, and this one is the cream of the crop.
phone[+3]##Best phone i've ever owned, period.
[t]
##I've been using this phone for 3 days now, and while I admit that seems doesn't seem like very long -- I should also point out that I've been using it almost non-stop.
phone[+3][p]##Frankly, I think this is one of the niftiest pieces of hardware I've ever used.
speed[+2]##It is slow to initially start up, but once it's turned on, I've never had any complaints about the speed.
##Over the past three days, I've only had to turn the phone off twice, so I rarely have to deal with the delay in initially booting the phone.
phone[+3][u]##Everything, so far, has worked flawlessly.
##I've synched it with my PC over bluetooth.
##I've synched it with my Jabra 250 bluetooth headset.
##I've been on the phone, while browsing the net over a GPRS connection, while sending a text message.
phone[+3][u]##All at the same time, and all without a hitch.
interface[+3]##I think the interface is great.
6600[+3][cc]##I actually purchased two phones recently (this one at the new Blackberry phone), and this one is far superior (IMHO).
##In short, I don't have a single negative thing to say.
features[+3],interface[+3],size[+3],camera[+3],internet connectivity[+3],quality[+3]##I love the features, the interface, the size (the screen is a delight), the camera (though I admit I'm not much of a camera user -- so just a toy for me), the internet connectivity, the quality, etc.
phone[+3]##If I had to do it over, I wouldn't buy anything else.
[t]
##I bought this phone after having other phones that had less-than-consistant reception.
signal[+3][u][cc]##UPSIDE: This one, like most Nokias, receives a consistently strong signal (I've tried some Samsung and Sony Ericsson models which were very weak on the reception front).
Bluetooth[+3]##I love the Bluetooth; easy to use with a wireless Jabra headset.
Photos[+3]##Photos are pretty darned good!
speed[-3][u]##DOWNSIDE: It takes a long time to start up.
speed[-3][u][cs]##My last simpler Nokia started right up and was immediately ready for use.
movies[-3][u]##The "movies" last about 5 seconds.
movies[-3][u]##I mean, they're short!
##Why have the function if you can't film anything longer than e few seconds?
feature[-3]##I find this feature on this phone useless, but, since I don't really need this function anyway, I don't really use it.
navigatee[-3]##Also, when I dial an "800" number like an airline, it will not allow me to use number keys to navigatee the prerecorded menu.
##This is a MUST when you need to get flight times, connect to reservations, etc.
screen[-3]##Finally, after about a week's use, the screen started to freeze on me.
calls[-3][p]##It would not hang up on calls.
screen[-3][p]##Once it froze so bad I couldn't even use the power button to turn it off, and had to open and take out the battery.
phone[+2]##Probably a great phone overall, and perhaps mine just has bugs.
##But beware of the bugs; they are major!
[t]
##What I have found useful to consider before purchasing a phone:  - decent battery life - good call quality - user-friendly interface - camera/video functions - bluetooth - ability to sync contacts stored in the PC with the phone (no more manual entries!)
user-interfaces[+3],bluetooth[+3],applications[+3],6600[+3]##With one of the most intuitive user-interfaces around, seamless bluetooth sync with Microsoft Outlook, support for thousands of applications for the Symbian platform which this phone runs on (I own the IR Remote, ICQ and a few others), the Nokia 6600 is all of the above - one of the few phones from T-Mobile that can claim such a distinction.
phone[+3]##Ive had this phone for a year now - and its the best phone I have owned.
camera[-2]##The only con I can think of is the lack of a mega-pixel camera.
##Motorola's phones are well engineered but have an user interface that reflects very poorly on what is otherwise an excellent engineering company.
##Its a real shame that T-Mo does not offer the newer Nokia models.
[t]
##According to a survey, more customers are ordering their cell phone and service from AMAZON.COM
[s]##But if you are one of the customers contributing to this, its a big mistake.
##I have ordered 2 "cell phone + service"s from Amazon.
## The first shipment took such a long time, I had to cancel it.
##The second one is on hold for almost 2 weeks with a message that "Can be delayed further".
[s]##So if you order one of the top 10 bestselling phones from Amazon now, it will take at least 3 weeks for your shipment to be delivered...guess Amazon is waiting for seconds to re-package,
[t]
phone[+2]##This may be a really cool phone, but it's not worth it with T-Mobile.
service[-3][p]##They have the worst service of any of the major companies.
T-Mobile[-3]##I really regret signing up with T-Mobile, but I'm stuck with them for the next 6 months of the contract.
[s]##If you're looking for a new company, don't be fooled by the service plans.
##T-Mobile's minute plans are cheaper for a reason.
[t]
phone[+3]##This phone is fantastic.
reception[+3],visibility[+3],interface[+3]##Great reception, visibility and interface (may be complicated by others).
rebate[-3]##Just don't get drawn into T-Mobile's catchy rebate.
rebate[-3]##T-Mobile wasn't upfront about some of the terms to qualify for the rebate.
[t]
phone[+3]##I highly recommend this phone.
Sony ericsson T610[+3][cc]##I had a Sony ericsson T610 before this and the T610 is far inferior.
[t]
back cover[-2], battery life[+3]##I find it difficult to remove back cover so is you plan to have a spare battery and replace it I suggest you don't ,besides it has a long battery life.
battery life[+3][u]##Im able to keep my phone on for about a week (mostly stand by) to three days (regular use)
[t]
##I used to work with t-mobile..
##i have owned many phones with them such as v60, 6190, e715, 6610, v66, v205.... and the list can go on!
phone[+3]##but this by far is the best phone out there right now!
large[-1][u],screen[+3]##yes it is a bit large, but the realestate on the screen will spoil you!
screens[+3][cc]##i have a hard time using other phones with smaller screens!!!
OS[-1]##the OS is abit confusing at 1st, but within a few days you will pass this learning curve!
##I use this phone as my quick and dirty digital camera!
pics[+3]##the pics can be touched up in photoshop, and be printed at 4x6 and they look great!
bluetooth[+3]##i also use the phone as my modem via bluetooth to my Apple powerbook!
bluetooth[+3][u]##The speed is the same as dail up, where i live we do not have wifi everywhere so this is my version of it until we catch up.
##I have used this wireless internet almost everywhere i travel and it works great.
##If you own an apple you can isync it to your address book so that you have all of you numbers in two places..... in case you lose your phone (get INSURACE)
##the stand by is really good considering all the toys this phone has and the screen size!
[s]##i would highly recommmend...... oh and i have owned this baby for like 6 months now
[t]
phone[+3]##The phone itself is pretty nice.
Camera quality[+2]##Camera quality isn't bad for the low resolution.
Menu[-1][u],phone[+3][u]##Menu is a bit slow, but overall, phone is very functional.
##But watch the Amazon rebates on these (T-Mobile rebate is fine).
##You have to wait to get your second bill before you can send the rebate form in. \
##Depending on the timing of the postmark date, you don't get your second bill until the postmark date passes, so it's impossible to qualify for the rebate.
[t]
features[+3]##This phone has a nice blend of features without going overboard.
Motorola T720i[-3][cc],calls[-3][cc],syncing data[-3][cc]##I was using a Motorola T720i with Verizon and I had alot of dropped calls and I had troubles syncing data.
Bluetooth[+3],battery life[+3],reception[+3],screen[+3]##I was looking for a phone which synced with Mac OSX using Bluetooth, had decent battery life, could check email, had good reception, nice screen size and was durable (I break often break small gadgets)
interface[+3]##The interface is simple to use.
menus[-2],menu[-2],load time[-2]##I saw a few complaints on the load time of menus and I feel people are over-exaggerating the menu load time.
menu[+2][u]##I have a couple hundred contacts and the menu loads within a few seconds, no big deal.
menus[+2][u]##I did notice if you turn the phone on and off the OS takes a bit to load up and initially the menus are slower but once the phone has been on and booted up the menus are reasonably quicker.
camera[+2]##The camera is adequate and if I want high-res photos I'll use my digital camera instead.
T-Mobile service[+3]##On the T-Mobile service I was able to take pics as we drove across I-70 and email them to family & friends once we reached a T-Mobile tzone (usually a major city).
T-Mobile service[+3]##Outside of the T-Mobile service area the phone seamlessly jumped onto AT&T Wireless and various other services where the T-Mobile service was unavailable.
reception[+3]##As I drove across the country I lost reception only in eastern Kentucky's mountains.
6600[+3][cs],battery life[+3],connectivity bars[+3],features[+3]##Along the way we compared it to my wife's T720i and the 6600 was superior in terms of battery life, connectivity bars and features.
iSync[+3][u]##For those Mac OSX users out there, iSync works fairly well.
Bluetooth[-1]##On occasion I'm not able to connect to the phone with iSync via Bluetooth but I found that rebooting the phone seems to solve this problem.
Bluetooth[+2],battery[+2]##And Bluetooth does not drain the battery as quick as I thought it would, I usually can go 1.5 days with Bluetooth on along with making calls before I need a full recharge.
battery[+2]##With Bluetooth off the phone last almost twice as long.
[t]
phone[+3]##The nokia 6600 is a great phone, good games, good camera.
video recorders[-1]##The video recorders a bit odd, sometimes I get 9 secs on my recordings, sometimes I get 17.
voice recorders[+2]##The voice recorders good, but you can't record songs off the radio for ring tones.
games[+1]##The games are decent, but u only get 2 to start off with.
games[+3]##But you can download some really good ones like pac-man or mafia wars.
phones[+3]##Overall the phones fantastic, and I would have given it 5 stars, but its not perfect.
[s]##If your looking for a phone thats mainly for calls and killing time this is the one you want.
battery[+3]##The battery on mine lasts 2 days if I don't play games that much, and it only takes 90 mins to charge from flat.
battery[+3]##This phone has the best battery, it lasts longer then my old 3210
[t]
MMC[+3]##I got a 1GB MMC upgrade for this phone and now I can:
video[+3]##1. Record around 1 hour of video with Phillips Camcorder Pro.
pictures[+3]##2. Take around 10,000 640x480 pictures.
games[+3]##3. Play Java games on it.
games[+3]##4. Play N-Gage games on it.
internet[+3]##5. Check traffic411.com for LA traffic on the 405.
games[+3]##6. Play Gameboy Color games on it with GoBoy.
speaker phone[+2]##7. Have a good chunk of my small MP3 to listen through the speaker phone.
bluetooth[+3]##8. Connected the phone to my tablet pc and now can access company VPN at 56k speed via bluetooth.
call logs[+1]##Clear the call logs once in a while to speed up the phone people!!!
bluetooth[+2]##As for bluetooth, no problems at all.
bluetooth[+2]##I've connected the phone with two laptops and a iPaq 4155.
bluetooth[+2]##Very simple and painless.
[t]
phone[+3]##This is the first cell phone I've owned, and overall, I am quite pleased with it.
[cs]##I purchased this phone after researching many different phones, mostly Nokia's that were T-Mobile compatiable.
phone[+2]##Among my requirments for a phone were: good screen, decent camera, bluetooth, and GPRS support.
6600[+3],phone[+3]##The 6600 was the best phone I could find with these options that I could get with t-mobile.
internet[+1]##One primary reason for getting a cell phone was so that I could use it as an internet connection for my laptop running linux, where softmodem drivers are hard to find, and don't work very well.
GPRS[+2]##If you are using Linux, and you want to use GPRS to connect to the net, I suggest this phone along with a Belkin USB Bluetooth adapter.
##For the linux users out there who are intrested in my setup: I'm running Debian (Knoppix 3.4) with a custom 2.6.7 kernel.
##On a DELL Inspiron 8200 with a P4 2.0ghz system with 1gb RAM.
##The KDE Bluez system for bluetooth support.
camera[+3]##I have really enjoyed the camera on this phone.
images[-1],camera[+2]##Although the images are not the best in the world, its very handy to have a camera everywhere you go.
feature[+2]##And the phone has a very cool feature wich allows you to send images via a normal POP3/SMTP e-mail account.
e-mail[+3]##I will also say that setting up the e-mail account was very simple and straight-forward, although you do need an external SMTP server to use.
ringtone[+2]##The phone can use any MIDI audio file as a ringtone.
ringtone[+3],music[+3]##Which is really nice because you can get pretty much any piece of music in MIDI format for free on the net.
bluetooth[+1]##You can use the OBEX File Transfer service with bluetooth from linux (KDE-bluetooth provieds a nice intergration into Konqueror for this) for sending files to the phone.
ringtones[+2]##The fact that you can assign ringtones to people and/or groups is really cool.
##Apparently some phones don't allow you to give an entire group a ringtone.
OS[-1]##I will say that the OS that the phone runs does have a few issues.
applications[-2]##Sometimes, various applications crash.
bluetooth[-2]##Especially the bluetooth server... Meaning you have to restart the phone if you want bluetooth to work again.
bluetooth[-2]##This is somewhat annoying, but from working with computers (espcially windows -- ugh...)
##I'm used to having to restart things.
##On average, I prolly restart the phone every two days.
##I use this phone exculsivly with a Jabra Freespeak 250.
Freespeak[+2]##I really dislike holding a phone to my ear, and I've found the Freespeak to be very comfortable and easy to use with this phone.
voice-dialing system[-2]##The only main drawback is the fact that the voice-dialing system is kinda picky.
voice-dialing system[-1][p]##It takes a while to learn how to use it right, and at this point I am able to make about 70% of my calls using it.
voice-dialing system[-2][p]##However, it needs to be quite quiet for it to work at all -- dosn't work at all in the car, for example.
size[-1],weight[-1]##Some people have commented about the size and weight of the phone, and it has rightfully gotten the nick-name "the bar of soap" which, it really is.
size[+1],weight[+1]##But if you use all bluetooth accessories, as I do, its really not an issue.
phone[+3]##All in all, this is a great phone.
price[+3]##Especially for the price amazon gives it at (I was unable to get mine through amazon due to some credit complications).
phone[+3]##If you use linux and want GRPS and/or want to use a handsfree bluetooth device, and want a decent camera -- this is the phone for you.
[t]
phone[+3]##I really love this phone...
T-Mobile[+3],ATT[-3]##I also am loving T-Mobile (100 times better than ATT...
T-Mobile[+3]##you actually can talk to a real person for support in under an hour!).
[t]
6600[+2][u],T-Mobile[+2]##Have had the Nokia 6600 for a year now and am generally very happy with it and with T-Mobile.
features[+2]##It offers way more features than I need but the ones I use work well.
signal[+3]##I almost always get a good strong signal, even in fairly remote areas here in the southwest.
sound[+3],speaker phone[+3]##The sound quality is excellent and the speaker phone couldn't be easier to use.
size[+2],shape[+2]##I like the size and shape.
size[+3],shape[+3]##It fits comfortably in my hand and pocket.
keys[-1]##The only problem is the size of the keys.
key[-1][u]##My fingers are kind of stubby so it took a while to learn how to hit a key without hitting the adjacent ones.
kays[-2][u]##They really are awfully small.
battery life[-1]##Also the battery life isn't great but it's sufficient for my needs.
calls[+1]##It also works just fine for international calls.
instant messaging[+2]##It's a bit pricey to call home from other countries but the instant messaging to and from covered countries in Europe are quite reasonable.
quality[+3]##It's really well made and has survived sliding across floors and pavement without a scratch.
T-Mobile[+3]##I've had nothing but good luck with T-Mobile.
customer service agents[+3],service[+3]##Their customer service agents are always prompt and polite and my service is terrific.
calls[+3]##I never get dropped calls.
T-Mobile[+3],Verizon[-1],Quest Wireless[-3]##It seems to be a much more user friendly company than Verizon and a thousand percent better than the horrible Quest Wireless.
T-Mobile[+3][s],6600[+3][s]##I recommend T-Mobile and the Nokia 6600 without reservation.
[t]
6600[+3][cs],3650[-2]##The Nokia 6600 is really just a glorified 3650: you know the 3650, those bulbous, formless, big phones a few unfortunate ATT customers are carrying around.
OS[+2]##The Nokia 660 runs the Symbian OS, which works pretty well for most standard phone fare, most of the stuff is not that intuitive, but if you actually learn how to use it all, there's plenty of neat tie-ins.
[t]
phone[+3],use[+3]##I've had this phone for almost a year now and it has been nothing but great to use.
bluetooth[+2]##I can connect to my computer via bluetooth to transfer images, calender events, contacts and anything else.
ringers[+3]##Another great feature for me anyway is the ability to load .wav sounds as ringers.
ringtones[+3]##This way I never have to be ripped off by the carrier for stupid ringtones, I can get whatever I want.
slow[-1]##The only downside I have found with this phone is that it is a bit slow to react, meaning when I push the contacts button, it takes a while to load, this is true for almost all the menus and programs on the phone.
OS[+3]##Other than that, the simbian series 60 OS is great and offers lots of proprietary software that will work on your phone if you're willing to hunt for it.
[t]
Hand set[+1],rebate[-1]##Hand set is good, but be aware of this T-MOBILE rebate.
rebate[-1]##These people takes lest effort to process rebate forms.
rebate[-2]##For last one month my Rebate status showing me that my rebate is apporved and check is delivered but still I am waiting for Check.
customer care[-2]##There is no way you can talk with customer care about this.
rebates[-2]##Dont rely on T-Mobile rebates.
[t]
##I bought 2 of these Nokia 6600 phones recently, thru the amazon market place.
features[+2],speaker phone[+1],web browser[+1],camera[+1]##Initially these phones were fun to play with some of the cool features like the speaker phone, web browser and ofcourse the built in camera.
##So on the whole, let me summarize the good and bad things about this phone, instead of writing a long review.
screen[+2],display[+2]##The good:  1) Large LCD screen, colorful display, good resolution.
features[+3],web browser[+1],camera[+1],video recorder[+1], speaker phone[+1],reception[+2]##2) Nice features, like web browser, camera, video recorder, speaker phone (very usefully), clear voice reception.
Joy stick[+2],memory card[+2]##3) Joy stick for eazy navigation, 35Mb memory card to store the pictures and stuff.
battery[-2]##Now the bad:  1) As usual, battery power not sufficient for daily usuage.
Joy stick[+2],memory card[+2]##3) Joy stick for eazy navigation, 35Mb memory card to store the pictures and stuff.
battery[-2]##The battery power discharges rapidly especially on using the web browser.
slow[-3][u]##2) Phone is awfully slow.
menu[-3][u]##Sometimes when you press buttons, the menu appears after a second or two.
size[+1],heavy[-2][u]##3) Phone is kinda heavy, but small in size.
##Looks big in the display ads though.
Buttons[-2][u]##4) Buttons are quite small and is really a pain exp if one is fond of text messaging.
Buttons[-2][u]##There will be much erasing of text as, one would tend to type something instead of the actual letters.
video recorder[-2]##5) Video recorder is of no use and one cannot record something useful in 10 seconds and it takes a while to send the same through the "Free picture and video messaging" offered by service provider.
##So my review should defintely give you an idea about this phone.
Phone[+1]##The bottom line is "Phone is cool one - only for the moment, as its the latest phone in the market and has all the new features, but this will soon be displaced by upcoming newer phones".
[t]
##my number one criteria for a new phone was iSync compaibility via bluetooth.
##all the other features are gravy.
##i checked the iSync compatibility page and it was listed--they even had a photo of the 6600 shown in the graphic.
iSync compaibility[-2][u]##so, right out of the box i had issue.
sync[-3]##namely, it wouldnt sync.
iSync compaibility[-3][u]##after scouring the various boards i find this is an arbitrary and pervasive problem.
##there are lengthy hacks offered requiring root access and edits via terminal.
##i may have been up for this 10 years ago, but i just want a phone that works at this point.
##i guess its my own fault for not researching more before buying the thing.
nokia[-3]##but, i am quite unhappy with nokia at the moment.
sonyericsson[+1]##if you are looking for a phone to integrate as easily as the sonyericsson phones with iSync, i say stick with a sonyericsson.
##i'd rather have a little more phone than the t610 offers.
##but, that's the only SE t-mobile offers right now.
##this nokia is going back to china or wherever it came from.
phone[-3][p]##if there was a zero-star rating i would give it.
[t]
##went with T mobile Nokia 6600 replacing my Sony T610.
phone[+1],reception[+2]##It is a multifunction phone, reception quality is better than the 610.
speaker phone[+2],MMC card[+2]##speaker phone quality is good, and poping in a 512mb MMC card, it rocks !
MP3 player[+2],games[+2],application[+2]##putting in MP3 player, lots of games and application to download.
size[-2]##DOwnside is the size of the phone, it is BIG for today's standard.
battery life[-3]##and the battery life is bad !
battery life[-3][u]##I could hardly use it without a recharge in 2 days!
battery life[-3][p]##a bit dissapoitnd on that!
GPRS[-3]##the GPRS web access is sloooooooooooooow!

phone[+1]##I got this phone yesterday and didn't find any problems with it yet.
Picture[+1],video[+1]##Picture and video quality is ok.
speaker phone[+2]##Love the speaker phone.
[t]
MEMORY[+3]##INCREDIBLE MEMORY!
MMC card[+3]##Aside from a 6MB++ built-in phone memory, there's a 32MB MMC card that goes with it!
Picture[+3],video[+2]##Picture quality's great for still and video with sound.
ringtone[+2]##you can record your voice and turn it into a ringtone.
Sony T610[-1][cc]##you can't do that with a Sony T610 (which i traded for a 6600).
T610[-1][cc]##T610 supports only midi files.
N6600[+2]##N6600 supports midi, wav, amr, mp3 etc.
N6600[+2]##it has a handsfree loudspeaker, conference and transfer!
##i'm having mine upgraded to capture endless video, which right now allows 10 secs.
##I'll have to buy bigger MMC card of course.
phone[+3]##I love this phone.
[t]
phone[+3]##This phone is one of the milestones in the history of the cellular phones.
OS[+2]##Supporting an operating system, Symbian OS, you can download and run a lot of programs on this phone.
phone[+3],size[+3]##You can turn this phone into a gaming machine, a camcorder or a digital camera, an mp3-player, a movie viewer, a voice recorder, a personal secretary, a GPS map browser, a book, a multifunction remote controller, practically everything that you can do with the computer, plus it is a phone(!!) and also you can carry it in your pocket :).
programs[+2][u]##Many of these programs are shareware, some can be purchased by paying a little bit of bucks.
MMC memory[+3]##It uses the extendable MMC memory, it is perfect for storing videos, pictures and mp3s.
look[+2]##Its nice look is also a plus.
SIM-card[+2]##And also, since it is tri band and since it uses SIM-card, you can just use it in Europe and many other parts of the world, wherever GSM exists.
phone[+3]##I am just in love with this phone, especially after using a more primitve phone about 3 years.
