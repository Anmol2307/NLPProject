size[+2],metal case[+1],use[+2],picture quality[+1],software[+2]##The good:  Small size; durable-seeming metal case; easy to use; visually distinctive; good picture quality; fast USB connection; mostly intuitive operation; really cool PhotoStitch software that knits pictures together to give wide panoramas.

size[+3],S100[+1]##If compact size is your highest priority in a 2-megapixel camera, the Canon PowerShot S100 Digital Elph is a standout choice and aptly named for its diminutive design.
image quality[+1],weighs[+2]##The S100's image quality rates in the middle of its class, but it can still be a reasonable choice for students, families, or small businesses looking for an ultra-portable camera that weighs less than half a pound with media and battery pack.

camera[+3]##I purchased this camera before it went on sale, and while I wouldn't have minded keeping the extra $$$, it was definitely worth it.
camera[+2],software[+2]##First, I have to say that I have NEVER had the slightest problem with this camera or the software.
camera[+1],performs[+1],picture[+2],battery[+1]##The camera is solid, performs well, takes good pictures, and the battery lasts pretty long if you disable the LCD viewfinder.
pictures[-1]##All that said, I am a little disappointed with the quality of the pictures from the camera.
sharp[+3],color balance[+3],focus[+2]##They are razor sharp, the color balance is perfect, and the focus is great.
pictures of people[-3]##When taking pictures of people, however, it shows EVERY flaw in the subject's skin.
processing[-1]##I will also say that it takes a very long moment for the camera to do its digital image processing between the time you press the button and when the camera actually takes the picture.
camera[+3]##I must say, I think this is the coolest camera I've ever  owned!
size[+3]##First, it really is tiny; the size of a pack of cigarettes, maybe  a scooch deeper.
use[+3]##Second, it is  incredibly easy to use.
photos[+2]##I just went on a quick photo shoot in NYC's  Central Park today, and what a bunch of beautiful photos I took, if I do  say so myself (and I do!)
use[+2][cc]##The camera is as easy to use as a point and  shoot, and with instant review on the LCD screen, you can retake any  flubbed shots on the spot.
optical zoom[+2],cap[+1]##The two-times optical zoom operates smoothly  and quietly, and lo and behold, a two-piece shutter-like cap automatically  slides closed over the lens when you turn the camera off.
