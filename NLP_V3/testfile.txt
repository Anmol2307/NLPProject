The good:  Small size; durable-seeming metal case; easy to use; visually distinctive; good picture quality; fast USB connection; mostly intuitive operation; really cool PhotoStitch software that knits pictures together to give wide panoramas.
If compact size is your highest priority in a 2-megapixel camera, the Canon PowerShot S100 Digital Elph is a standout choice and aptly named for its diminutive design.
The S100's image quality rates in the middle of its class, but it can still be a reasonable choice for students, families, or small businesses looking for an ultra-portable camera that weighs less than half a pound with media and battery pack.
I purchased this camera before it went on sale, and while I wouldn't have minded keeping the extra $$$, it was definitely worth it.
First, I have to say that I have NEVER had the slightest problem with this camera or the software.
The camera is solid, performs well, takes good pictures, and the battery lasts pretty long if you disable the LCD viewfinder.
All that said, I am a little disappointed with the quality of the pictures from the camera.
They are razor sharp, the color balance is perfect, and the focus is great.
When taking pictures of people, however, it shows EVERY flaw in the subject's skin.
I will also say that it takes a very long moment for the camera to do its digital image processing between the time you press the button and when the camera actually takes the picture.
I must say, I think this is the coolest camera I've ever  owned!
First, it really is tiny; the size of a pack of cigarettes, maybe  a scooch deeper.
Second, it is  incredibly easy to use.
I just went on a quick photo shoot in NYC's  Central Park today, and what a bunch of beautiful photos I took, if I do  say so myself (and I do!)
The camera is as easy to use as a point and  shoot, and with instant review on the LCD screen, you can retake any  flubbed shots on the spot.
The two-times optical zoom operates smoothly  and quietly, and lo and behold, a two-piece shutter-like cap automatically  slides closed over the lens when you turn the camera off.
