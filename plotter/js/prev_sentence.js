$(function(){$("#query").html("Good but not the bestI am into photography for 17 years now and this is my third SLR camera. I was a bit surprised with the number of 5 stars this camera is getting and was wondering if this really deserves this.Simply put, the Canon 1200d is to dSLR what a Tata nano is to cars. There are the BMWs, Audis and the Swifts, but only cost does not give this a Five stars!Most of the 5 stars are from 1st time SLR users who are in the so called honey moon period. I am not saying this camera is bad, but this is being over hyped here.Remember, this camera has its limitations due to its low cost build. There are so many point and shoot cameras at the 12K range that have better build, resolution, zoom, aperture, display screen, good glass lens, panel and what not? Most of the features in dSLR are things which you would NEVER use and that???s the reason I am saying please get a camera for your requirement and not just because you are getting a cheap dSLR.Do not sell your Harley Davison to buy a Tata Nano. This is a doctor???s prescription, what works for me may not work for you. I am just trying to be sensible here.My two cents to all proud owners ???1. Canon has given you a wonderful lens. Do not spoil it with a UV filter. Most filters sold are just glass pieces that do more harm than good to the photos.2. Try to put the cam on Manual focus. Half click as you focus till you get the beep. It takes time to learn but this will give you sensational pics and also will save the battery and the lens. Remember lens can get damaged if it is in AF and you try to focus manually.3. Never change the lens in a dusty place. Invisible dust can enter the cam and can cause blurring in picture.Great camera for first timers - Value for moneyWhat makes this camera great is the price point at which it is being offered at. Considering a beginner gets to start with two kit lenses, this is a good first SLR camera. And both kit lenses are pretty capable, given that they were released only a few years ago, and are IS lenses. I think if 50mm f/1.8 prime lens is added to the collection, this camera can be a powerful machine at very competitive price.Night time shooting was pretty great, and IS lenses did show up their magic when shooting in low light. Especially notable is the quality of image for 55-250 zoom lens at telephoto end because of IS capability of the lens.Scene Intelligent Auto gives great results, if you are not in a mood to do all the manual settings.Pros:Price of the packageTwo IS kit lenses, covering from 18mm to 250mmEasily accessible buttons and intuitive camera menu navigationVarious exposure control options like sports, night portrait, creative auto etc.Cons:In view of price of the package, nothing significant to mention. Would have preferred auto sensor cleaning feature, which is not there.**Notes after four months of camera usage:1. Would recommend anybody using DPP for the first time to go through the 19 videos that are there on YouTube as 'Canon Digital Photo Professional Tutorial'. They are immensely useful.2. Continuous shooting - was able to get 88 JPEGs (fine, large) in 29 seconds approximately, before the camera paused for a very short breath. This was using a 16GB SDHC UHS-I Class 10 memory card. Also it was able to clock 6 RAW in approx. 3 seconds. As these results are not from standard lab conditions, and depend on various factors, other users may get different results.One hell of a camera, so is the deal!Guys, if you are reading this review to know how good/bad this camera deal is, please stop reading and buy it. I am a first time DSLR user and am being blown away by the picture quality and ease of use. The camera performs brilliant at whatever the conditions are really (low light etc).The kit lens 18-55mm is actually very nice and produces some brilliant pictures (which I kind of never expected to be honest). The additional zoom lens 55-250mm is a blessing! What a lens! I am in sooo much love with it. It puts a smile on my face every time I click pictures with it. I think it is quite difficult to find such a great camera with two awesome lenses at this price.My recommendation? BUY IT, TREAT YOURSELF!Awesome Service.Great Price and best entry level DSLR with unbeatable priceAwesome Service.Great Price and best entry level DSLR. Firstly I got this deal at 20990/- for the combo lense deal which is great.secondly the Amezon service was prompt and delivered the Cam in time. Inside Packing was not that great considering the Camera is delicate pc of equipment but no damage happened to my Cam.This is my first DSLR and did lot of reserch before buying it. I was lucky to try this CAm earliar.Though lot of openion says Nikon 3300 is batter due to some of batter fetures but considering the deal i got ,its hard to beat.Tried some of pics and they were gr8.both the Lenses are working gr8.You may miss touch screen and fixed lcd screen was big let down but again the price tag justify this greatly.The deal now showing around 26k in the site so feeling lucky to book it in correct time.Best buy for beginners on a budgetBuying experience:Excellent Delivery by Amazon, was my first online buying experience. I bought this combo in June'ish period, and amazon's pricing was the least compared to other online giants. I chose the one day deliver option, and the service was prompt, got the product, in the afternoon of the expected day, fabulously packet, no issues there,Camera body (1200d):I have always been a shutter bug, experimenting with my earlier ps cameras, which were sony make and decided to move on the dslr series. As a startup kit, this 1200d lets you get around the basics of photography, features a full manual mode, and has an intelligent auto mode, in case your parents want to use it either. It delivers as promised, and is a great over all starter.Pros:Make :Decent make, no flimsinessBattery: life better than expected, ran three full days shooting 900+ images without a battery problem.Overall: Value for money.LCD : Good quality , has'nt troubled yetweight: lightweight compared to its bigger brothersCons (There are better camera which will beat this one, but on a higher budget)Live view: Autofocus in the live view( lcd viewing) is very slow and takes ages.Microphone :Does not feature an external microphone jack , which may be a disappointment for young movie makersFlash: the inbuilt flash is steady, but takes time to recharge after 30 -40 continuous charge, which can be cumbersome in event photographyProcessor: Digic 4 processor instead of the new digic 5PS: enthusiasts who want to go for WILDLIFE PHOTOGRAPHY , and want to buy their first camera, I suggest them not to go for an DSLR. You will need to spend atleast RS.2lakhs to get a good quality camera and zoom lens. The same zoom(some say better) is offered by PScamera like the new canon sx60 or sx50 (powershot) , and nikon offers the coolpics. The only problem with those cameras is that they have fixed lenses , so, when you get really interested into the field, you cant buy a fisheye, or a 50 f1.2 , and use it with those cameras.PPS: COLLEGE STUDENTS : buyers who want this camera only for taking good PROFILE PICTURES of yourselves and other, you may want to add the 50mm f1.8 to this combo. Excellent lens for portraits, google 50mm 1.8 pictures on 500px.IF you buy a 600d or a 70d your budget is streched as it is but this kit, with the 18-55, 55-250 , and the 50 f1.8 will be 40kish , approx the price of the 600d with the kit lens( trust me i've spent hours on the comparison.All in all, great buy for great budget.The canon 1200 D is a nicely designed product and with all the 3 lenses provided ...I wish to thank Amazon for the most professional service.I booked the camera on Saturday nightand  to my surprise, I received the product @ my door steps next day at 11 o clock in the morning.I never expected to get such a quick delivery.especially on Sunday !!The canon 1200 D is a nicely designed product and with all the 3 lenses provided along with the camerait covers the whole range.I am enjoying different experiments and getting the never before results asfar as the quality of pictures.For those who love photography and those who wish to take everyday picturesdifferently,this camera is the best.If anyone is thinking of it's purchase,now this is the time to decide and act.Because the price is very much attractive.Easy to use,Entry Level DSLR from CanonCanon EOS 1200D (EOS Rebel T5 / EOS Kiss X70) is a successor to Canon's popular entry level DSLR Canon EOS 1100D.# Highlights1) 18MP Sensor powered by a DIGIC 4 processor ( 1100D - 12MP only). The DIGIC 4 processor is not the newest from the Canon.2) 3-inch, 460k-dot LCD screen. (1100D - 2.7inch ). The LCD screen is a Fixed one,NOT tilt-able,nor it offers a Touch screen as you can expect from an entry level DSLR.3) EOS Companion app ( Android and iOS ) for beginners,filled with some tips,guides and tutorials.4) Good build Quality,better than its predecessor EOS 1100D.5) Dedicated buttons for white balance and ISO.6) It has several automatic modes,scene recognition modes and creative modes.7) 3fps Shooting speed and 9 point Auto Focus ( both same as in older 1100D ).8) ISO up to 12800 (in expanded mode) supported,though anything above 6400 will have visible noise in images.9) 1080p @ 30, 25 and 24fps are supported while 1100D only supports 720P.10) NO wifi/nfc.Main competitors to this camera are Nikon D3300 and Pentax 500. Nikon D3300 has more auto focus points (11) than D1200 and the ISO in expanded mode can reach 25600. D3300 also offers faster shooting speed ( 5fps ),better LCD resolution (921,000-dot),more video shooting modes - 60fps and 50fps frame rates for half-speed slow-motion effects, more shots from a single charge (700 shots,while 1200D can shoot upto 500 shots ).Since the price of Canon 1200D and Nikon D3300 is similar in Amazon,my recommendation is that its better to get Nikon D3300 instead of Canon 1200D.Amazing entry level DSLR deal to go for! (thumbs up for Price to performance)Canon EOS 1200D is an exceptional rugged Camera for entry level photographers and produced really good shots. The Amazon's special diwali package of both lenses with body at approx 20 k was a irresistible deal and just turned the table when I was fixed with Nikon 3300.Suggestions for fellow-beginners:1.When you buy DSLR for 1st time after shifting from Point  shoot, keep aside the notion of "Megapixels" as even with 18 MP Canon 1200D can produce top quality shots, because the thumb rule goes that the lenses are the main gear for picture quality and Canon has really strong flagship quality in this area (I do vouch the same after many shots).2.Eventhough Automode is there, please forget it and start exploring with creative mode and preferable Manual itself. Stay in the same spot and take same pictures at different ISO/Shutterspeed/Exposure to know the dynamics.3.Save in RAW format for post editing.4. For macros you may not have to immediately jump into another dedicated macro lens. First explore with reversal of kit lens/Zoom lens+reverse kit lens, which already comes in the deal.5. Always think of an extra gear if you really are fed up that existing gear is not sufficient. For this you have to explore the shots with existing gear and realize the lack of possibility for yourself.6.Instead of buying for a remote, think of setting the camera on 2-sec timer and taking the shot without risk of hand press affecting slow shutter speed. Camera already has the setting7. You might need a tripod for DSLR "sometimes". If so don???t go for a cheap one and risk damaging your Camera. Many a times use the available stationary to rest the camera as carrying a big tripod everywhere will kill your passion and make it boring8. Planning for a lens filter (use judiciously as it will disrupt image quality also), protective gear, cleaning kit is a perfect insurance.9. Handle the gear very carefully keeping in mind ???Its Glass inside???if it breaks, I have to spend a more than this price on lenses alone???. Don???t change lenses in dusty places and beached where water spays are there.10. When going for a shoot, preset the manual settings of exposure, iso, etc to the shots you are planning.Pros:1. Best entry level DSLR package - look out for festive seasons2. 55-200 Zoom lens also in same price ??? unimaginable combo!!3. Comparatively new entry in market to replace 1100D. So investment is kind of secure and less regrets of having an outdated model soon4. Top class delivery in terms of time and packaging5. The ???Elite Canon user??? status among shutterbugs6. Low light performance is superb!7. DSLR market standards of shutterspeed, ISO limits maintained without compromising for price8. Battery life is good and flash quality is nice.Cons:1.The Digi 4 processor is a bit old-generation and occasionally you understand it in the picture quality.2. Live view focus is very sluggish and difficult3. No rotatable LCD, but being an entry level DSLR this is quite understandable4. Editing software is modular and not that user friendly. Lot of scope of improvement from basics like reviewing images with thumbnail + enlarged parallely, Watermarking, etc.5. Canon use to market that the Photo editing software of Canon is lifetime valid v/s Nikon???s 6 month valid Software. But end of day you end up anyways with Photoshop mostly if you need to edit6. Bag is of average quality only and may not fit the body + 2 lenses properly7. I didn???t get the powerbank which was given by Canon at the time of purchase.8. Canon educational resources are limited as less detail on the manuals, no seats in complementary workshops for 2 months9. Unavailability of Canon 1200D companion android app in India. Doesn???t make much difference anyways.Overall it was a super-satisfied purchase.Happy Clicking..!!!!An ideal learners camera(better than Nion D3300 for a beginner)I own both Nikon D3300 and now 1200D. I can now, with confidence say that this is a much a better learners camera if you are just venturing into DSLR zone.Nikon is very good for what it does,sturdy built but it has no depth of field preview, no white balance and exposure bracketing, no flash exposure lock etc.Live view sucks battery like anything.You will do well to get the Dummies book by Juie Aldair King to get the maximum benefit out of this camera.The menus are simpler, the live view mode lets you see how the aperture changes effect your view, through a special function setting you can have the SET button allow you the depth of field preview.Additionally, in Aperture(Av) or Shutter priority(Tv) modes- the display indicates with a symbol, the respective settings that can be changed.Pressing the Q button will help you navigate through other available setting with a pop-up that explains the function of that setting.The colour coding is also good.The preview button is blue and the all the buttons that have dual colour symbols(blue/white) work coupled with their colour setting.The ISO levels and megapixels are less than Nikon but it is unlikely that a learner is going to need 24 MP for an A3 print of his/her snaps.A learner needs to know how the changes that are being made effect the picture, so small gradations don't help with that but previewing does .This camera has larger jumps, less range and less variations but If you have bought this camera at the current price of 20K with 2 lenses , then this is a steal .Buy a circular polarizing filter, a dummies book on kindle, download the pdf manual from website and hit the trail.BOTTOM LINE : Best Entry Level Camera for noobs :DNo words to describe !This is my first DSLR Camera and I am very lucky to have this beast ! Its really worth a buy for price I got which was 25K :DBoth the lenses are awesome for capturing the images! build quality is as superior as canon always offer!Here are the Sample Images Clicked by me :https://flic.kr/ps/2VfzXD

It becomes very difficult to fit in the camera and the 2 lenses in that bag.It would have been better if the bag would have been bigger so that it could very well hold the Camera, its lenses and some accessories / peripherals, e.g. Battery Charger, USB Cable.I would request Amazon, that they could ensure slightly more better governance against the sellers and keep a track of what all accessories/freebies are provided by the sellers.Otherwise, the product (the camera itself) doesn't have any complaints against it.Beginner's boon!I got this product delivered to me using "One day delivery", and it was well protected from the usual damages people experience normally.

ultimate experiance with amazonBest dslr from Canon, superb picture quality, easy to use in auto+ intelligent mode for first-time dslr user, thanks to Canon for a awesome product, and also thanks to Amazon and saholic??for genuine product of Canon with best price point.AwesomeAwesome DSLR. This is my first DSLR and I loved it. Super easy to start off  as beginer. camera quality , packaging , delivery and price all very good.5 stars for Amazon service for the full support and super fast delivery.First dslr. got warranty too. :)This is my first dslr.. Not much of a photographer till now.. Bought it just for the deal.. Got it for 25k with dual lens.. There are better photographers who can tell you the pros and cons of the camera or just watch YouTube reviews.. But yeah this is my entry to the world of photography.. I would like to add the most important thing which was worrying buyers like me is the warranty issue.. For warranty please log in to the canon.co.in site and register the product using the serial number which is located in the sticker below the body of the camera and the warranty will be valid.Thank you amazon and thank you canon.priceI bought it at 32500. It was a good price for me. It was cheap as compared to the price of the stores. After some hours the price dropped to 31500. I hope I had bought it at 31500.Good camera value for moneyExcellent camera and got for a best ever price of Rs.21k... But if you had used Nikon before you might feel little inconvenient with the settings of the camera especially with the lenses as the zoom rotation is reverse motion. So I had missed some beautiful clicks die to time mismatch. Still I believe I'll be comfortable handling it over a period of time...The delivery is the worst part of my experience... I didn't get the consignment on the committed date. I had waited more than 10 days to receive my camera. Not only this, even my other purchases are not delivered on time...Good deal.... best cameraBest available deal and the best camera available at this price. Mind it, THE BEST at this price.I would recommend this to all who are not pursuing photography as profession but still likes photography and dream to own a DSLR, this fulfills all the requirements and price is unbeatable. I got this for 20,990. keep watching this space for good deals.Really good product very satisfied however delivery is pathetic. The ARAMAX courier service could not track my shipment after 17 days of making payment. I had to collect my shipment once I escalated the matter after 17 daysAwesome product go for it.........!!!Awesome product with offer........... Yes my doubts got cleared i got my warranty for 2years, i spoke with one of the sales person from canon said they will register my warranty details and update, and before they register amazon already had it for 2yrs, so canon will again register with customers name as per the purchase date  will give you whole 2yrs warranty.Apart from the warranty product came with good condition and perfect packing.Now about the cam Canon EOS 1200D would be great for people with basic skill set in photography and ofcourse works fine too.Excellent product   ,Profitable.....I have purchased this item @ 23849( Ordering time price is Rs-25099-Sbi Debit card less 10 percentage, but Maximum less Rs-1250),Camera Body + 18-55 lens,55-250 lens +battery +charger+8 GB card+Carry case Special Season gift (from Canon) 5000 mah Power Bank(for mobile recharging)Totally Amazon  provide grand profit to customersThanks for Amazon .Product ReviewExcellent clarity,User friendly,Thailand made Quality Product,Pictures are very colorful,.Stop your comparison and purchase it !...........Good Product.....Awesome CameraI am an amateur user to this DSLR league... I have been using my brother-in-law's 1100D and was always wanting to buy one... I was completely fed up with point n shoot  mobile cams... Amazon gave an amazing deal worth every rupee spent.. Got the cam a week before my HK trip and took a lot of pics.. It would not be appropriate for me to provide a detailed technical review as there are so much available... But trust me this is the best camera for this budget... Clicked few photos of food, people, moving train, ferries, birds, buildings, sky, rain and it looks damn good...The camera quality is good. AlthoughThe camera quality is good.Although, I'm still awaiting response to issue which I raised. As per the order details, I was to get power bank free.I'm still waiting for the same.");});
